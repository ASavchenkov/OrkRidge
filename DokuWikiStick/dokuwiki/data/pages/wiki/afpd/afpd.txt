====== Argument For Poor Design ======

This is a cyberpunk/modern companion adventure to [[wiki:orkridge:orkridge|Ork Ridge]], focused on the engineering aspect of ethical conundrums such as creating artificial intelligence. Talking about the philosophy of sentience is all well and good, but what happens when someone //actually makes one//? What would that look like? Who would be funding it, and what constraints would the creators be working under?

[[wiki:afpd:Kamen Korp|Kamen Korp]] is the only company that makes segways, and lobbies to make sure no one else can make them. The fine is 20% of gross revenue before taxes.

[[wiki:afpd:Solarion|Solarion]] has low orbit vacations for those who can pay up, and [[wiki:afpd:Noblesse O.|Noblesse O.]] has secured a contract with a number of large nations to create the first ever Skyhook.

Dark Ocon has rebranded into the company [[wiki:afpd:Academica|Academica]] and has a number of lucrative defense contracts globally both with governments and corps.

None of these corporations are above underhanded subterfuge, especially since socioeconomic inequality is the focus of most politics, and politicians are in the pockets of the larger corporations. War between LLCs is as frequent if not more so than it is between rival nations, and if you want to make money, you have to get involved.

[[wiki:afpd:Fawkes News]] owns most media outlets. The [[wiki:afpd:White Claw Times|White Claw Times]] is the only independent source left.
