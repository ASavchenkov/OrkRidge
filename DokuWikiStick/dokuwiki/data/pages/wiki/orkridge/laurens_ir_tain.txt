One of the wealthiest men in Eberron, and the wealthiest in Sharn, Laurens ir'Tain is one of the few humans out there who can afford to regularly swap between clones when he dies either violently, of old age, or just wants to swap bodies. He's been alive for centuries despite being a human.

His wife Celyria ir'Tain is known for the Tain Gala that she organizes every month.
