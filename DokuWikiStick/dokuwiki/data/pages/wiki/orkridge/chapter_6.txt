[[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] was teleported to Eberron, specifically into the heart of the Mournland. The good news is that much like [[wiki:orkridge:the Lost Peaks]], the ground level of New Elfington is higher than the ground level of where it was teleported to, about 1 KM above, meaning the inhabitants of the city are safe from the Gray Mist.

Far away, at [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Arythawn_Keep | Arythawn Keep]], Thranian scout officer [[wiki:orkridge:Ogma Fronis]] is called to the watchtower.

"What the fuck.... Tira Miron above..."

"Sound the alarm. Send animal messengers to Vathirond and Aruldsk. Tell Vathirond to fortify for an unknown threat, and to send for help. The Mournland is... moving."

An eagle makes it to Vathirond, reaching a human. That human relays the message, and just barely makes it on the train headed to Starilaskur. When she gets there, she immediately passes the information on to an elven mage that casts sending to a military official in Sharn.

====== The Whole City ======

It is only to the East that anyone can see land not covered in this Gray Mist.

The contingent of Oosah military that happened to be in New Elfington, led by Dron at the time rapidly institutes martial law. Citizens are obviously terrified of what happened. Leosh Teller and his crew are jailed for terrorism, and Dron enlists the party in taking on dangerous tasks.

===== Vagrants and Activists =====


The first is to deal with some rioters that have taken over food stores and taken hostages. He's reluctant to send the military in. The gang believes that the government will not ration food fairly.

===== Explore the Mist =====

Dron wants to know everything he possibly can about the mist below. Is it dangerous? How deep does it go? What's underneath it? He tasks the party with discovering all of this.

===== First Contact =====

On the second day, an airship is spotted North-East of the city. It seems to be headed right for them. This is a house of the Lyrandar airship sent by the nation of [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Thrane | Thrane]]. Within hours a second airship is spotted behind and to the South of it. This one was sent by [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Breland | Breland]]. Both border the Mournland, and both want to claim domain over whatever the hell is happening here. Other nations will follow, but their spies have yet to hear of this development.
