====== New Elfington ======

This is the city the party ends up in after escaping [[wiki:orkridge:Neverwinter]].

====== Factions ======

Numerous groups are vying for control, or simply trying to survive in this city.

===== Duads =====

A large criminal organization primarily focused on illegal drugs, the Duads have recently been making big profits off of [some new drug]. In my case it was **powdered gold**.

This drug is so popular during wartime that they even start branching out into music. They've been looking to acquire the [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington#Swing Sisters]], but they've not been receptive to the Duads business propositions.

===== Swing Sisters =====

<del>Plagiarized from</del> "Inspired by" the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(film)|Blues Brothers]], and the center of the [[wiki:orkridge:Swing Sisters]] side quest.

A band consisting of [[wiki:notable_individuals#Jackie Swing]], [[wiki:notable_individuals#Ellie Swing]], as well as a complement of talented musicians from their long gone past. They're looking to do one last gig to pay their old churches taxes and save it.

The law is hot on their tail though, after a number of egregious moving violations.
They've also stolen business from The [[wiki:orkridge:new_elfington#Duads]] own musical efforts, but it's all OK because they're "on a mission from God".

===== Warforged =====

In all of Faerun there are 100 Warforged, transported here by "The Device" from one of the planets under the rule of [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron]]. More details on this are presented [[wiki:orkridge:the_lost_peaks|here]].

With the ability to cheaply resurrect Warforged (provided by [[wiki:notable_individuals#Funky Claude]]), they're able to dominate the local demolition derby scene.

This was not to the liking of the Duads, and when the Warforged were not willing to fix matches, a gang war of sorts broke out. The Duads were losing until they managed to "kill" [[wiki:notable_individuals#Funky Claude]] in a sneak attack.

Unfortunately, Claude recently disappeared, and the bodies have slowly been piling up. By the time the party shows up, there is only one Warforged left, and he's planning to run a team of non Warforged.
====== Notable Locations ======

===== Logistics Headquarters =====

The first place the party visits. It's a pyramidal structure with some modest dormitories that the party might make use of depending on the relationship they build with [[wiki:notable_individuals#The General]] and [[wiki:notable_individuals#Dron]].

===== Theater =====

Where the party might go to relax and see a show, potentially the **Swing Sisters** reunion show.

===== Derby Arena =====

An enormous arena used to stage highly violent demolition derbies.

===== Duad Hideout =====

A hideout that the Duads stage their operations from.
