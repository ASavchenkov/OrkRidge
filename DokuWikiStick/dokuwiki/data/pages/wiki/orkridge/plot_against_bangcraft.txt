This plot is basically entirely lifted from the book "Altered Carbon." I figured it was a fantastic fit for the Eberron universe.

The wealthy aristocracy of the Skyway have plenty of vices, but none are considered quite as depraved  by high society as being a furry oddly enough. They seem to have a thing about racial purity...

Despite this, a great number of the wealthy and powerful find Tabaxi and the like hot. Who can blame them? [[wiki:orkridge:Reileen d'Thuranni]] has splintered off house Thuranni to run a criminal organization, and one of the things her organization supplies is discreet furry prostitution for the wealthy.

Unfortunately, one tabaxi seems to have died during transport, and picked up by the city watch. Officials would normally cast speak to dead to find out what happened, but apparently her religion has her listed as "pro-life." That is to say, no necromancy is to ever be cast on her, even after her death.

Reileen needs someone to oppose the recent push to abolish laws respecting these requests, so she gets [[wiki:orkridge:Bangcraft]] into this. After he tries it, he's disgusted with himself, scrambles his recent memories with a magic scroll, and kills himself, resurrecting in a clone. It is at this point that he hires the party to investigate his suicide.
