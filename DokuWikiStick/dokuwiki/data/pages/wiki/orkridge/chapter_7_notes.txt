====== Campaign Notes ======

During the night, **The Goose** wanted to go out to pee, but smelled beef jerky. He followed the scent to the nearest hospital, where he wreaked havoc, and got super high on **Dreamily jerky**.

Zanriel got some "services" from a mob water elemental.
===== Character Goals =====

==== Zanriel ====

=== Boromar Clan ===
Working with the Boromar Clan to build smuggling trade routes to New Elfington (since Thrane is setting up a quarantine.)

That being said, they're not happy with his performance at the United Kingdoms, so his room key at the luxury hotel is invalidated, with a note left for him. "Everybody gets one."

=== Hexblade ===

Hexblade asks Zanriel to steal the hot rock for him.

Hexblade is tired of Shadowfell, and it's not alone. It and his comrades want light.

After [[wiki:orkridge:Chapter 1#The Device | a random mountain]] teleports to Shadowfell, it realizes that whatever magic caused this could be used to teleport his entire city into the Feywild.

It is in the interest of this goal that it employs a number of Warlocks to collect items and information of relevance to this teleportation magic. When one of his warlocks is teleported during the events of [[wiki:orkridge:chapter_5| The Financial Crash]], it realizes that whatever material [[wiki:orkridge:Leosh]] used could speed his efforts.

It needs the lichium used in Eberronian Sky Coaches. Once it collects enough, it creates the device, and teleports the entire cliff city of Edgeton to... Eberron, right at the end of the [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)]]. That's right, directing the device is //hard//.


==== Char Marks ====

Talking with [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Magi Suko]] about getting medical supplies to New Elfington (potentially via a Boromar Smuggling route).

Also interested in getting more involved in science.

Also looking to build up an industry either here or in Faerun.

==== P4-A1 ====

Looking to take down the orbital blockade net by finding members of the previous government.

The war has only just ended, and most effort has been on rebuilding, not getting back into space, but it is rumored that the control bunker is still dormant somewhere in [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#Metrol]].
==== Wedge ====

[[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Laurens ir'Tain]] mentions to Wedge when they're leaving.

"Oh. You there. I've been looking for an outsiders touch on something. Come by the ir'Tain manor if you're up for some well paying work."

He is hiring Wedge to resolve the [[wiki:orkridge:plot_against_laurens]]

More-phine?

[[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Iyanna ir'Talan]] notices him at the pharmacy picking up the (legal and recreational) morphine. "Yo just cause it's legal doesn't mean you should be doing it."

She thinks that morphine was made legal just because the large corps already had large production facilities for it, and the city decided to just tax it since it needs the money. She's unhappy with her father's complacency with the situation too.

==== Roveliss ====

Roveliss is aiming to create an underground zen network of bards. Unfortunately Eberron already has a network of bards, in the form of a corporate propaganda machine called **The Circle of Song**. Corrupted by the economic influence of the Dragonmarked houses, this organization primarily creates "sponsored content", and is always happy to have someone new to exploit.

Not everyone in this organization has given up though, and given some pushing, bards around Eberron might attempt to reclaim their artistic integrity.
===== Next Session Plans =====

It rains that night. When they wake up, they see a rainbow. For everyone except for Paul, this is the first time they've ever seen a rainbow, and it kinda hurts to look at. Paul realizes that he's never seen a rainbow on Faerun.
