Hundreds of thousands of soldiers come home, many permanently injured. They want homes, jobs, and medical care, and thus the housing and medical industries boom. The financing industry comes along for the ride, promising rapid funding to help firms compete, albeit with high interest rates.

The economy booms, and this debt becomes commonplace, and more complex. CDOs and synthetic CDOs are designed for mortgages and medical debt. Bankers make incredible fees selling and trading these financial products. The valuation of these products grows far higher than the real value. Whether bankers did this on purpose or through incompetence isn't a particularly important question. The damage is done, and they did it.

The bubble pops, and shit rolls downhill as always. Hundreds of thousands lose their homes. Millions more lose retirement funds that had been invested in these bad financial products. The money didn't just disappear overnight. It was simply eaten up by ludicrous fees, hidden by inflated product valuations. The crash just showed everyone that the money was gone.

The crash spills into other nations, affecting the entire globe. A conference is arranged in New Elfington to figure out a global response to this crisis. Representatives from governments and financial institutions globally show up for the largest financial conference in the history of Faerun.
