====== Neverwinter ======


Neverwinter is the capital city of [[wiki:orkridge:Faerun#Esania]]

===== Notable Locations =====

==== Actor Tower ====

Upon it's construction, Actor Tower will be the tallest artificial structure on Faerun. At 324m, it is more than twice the height of the previous record holder. It's designed to be a corporate and scientific headquarters for numerous businesses.

It's primary features are it's set of elevators, and it's electrically powered utilities.

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Azusa Actor]] has been developing a number of electrically powered weapons on the 20th floor of this tower under "instruction" from the Gerbaut military.

==== Actor Manor ====
The **Actor Family** resides here, including [[wiki:notable_individuals#Azusa Actor]]. Underneath is a secret cave in which Azusa keeps her [[wiki:notable_individuals#Char Marks]] outfit and gear.

==== Resistance Hideout ====

The husk of an unfinished shoreline hotel stands in the slums on the South Beach. Due to recent increases in sewage primarily flowing South from the river, this beachfront property decreased in value so much that developers stopped in their tracks. The Resistance hides out here as the Gerbaut generally don't want to deal with the poor of the city.
