====== Donald Quixote ======

If the players ever spend time in a small town, they'll come across some kids complaining:

//"Aww man. I can't believe that crazy dude won't let us check it out. I swear it really is haunted!"// -**Cattylan Brosnalian**

That crazy dude is **Donald Quixote**, a paladin on a noble steed (a donkey). If they get too close to the "haunted windmill", he stops them and says:

//"Go no further! See the beasts ahead? Enormous monstrosities menace you with their blades!"//
He is pointing at a windmill.

//"I will dispense with it and then you may pass."//

He then charges with his lance at the windmill, and predictably sticks into it, not affecting it at all.

====== Windmill Mimic ======

That's right. The windmill really is a monster. It's a Gargantuan Mimic. Fighting it happens in two phases.

  - Windmill Form: The blades move towards the bottom, and start spinning horizontally. These are it's weapons, and they're sticky, so don't get hit by them.
  - Mimic Form: Once it's captured enough of the party, or been taken down enough health, it turns into its shapeless mimic form, and starts gobbling people up.
