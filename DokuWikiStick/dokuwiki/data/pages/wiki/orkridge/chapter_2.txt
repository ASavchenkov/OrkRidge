====== Adventures in New Elfington ======

Upon going through the teleportation circle, the party ends up in the center of a large circular room, with a large platform surrounding it, and magical displays around the walls. Many soldiers are pointing muskets at them, no armor, just military uniforms.

“Intruders: Identify yourselves immediately under threat of being shot!”
This is [[wiki:notable_individuals#The General]]. I always imagined him as the TF2 Soldier. Beside him is his trusty aide [[wiki:notable_individuals#Dron]].

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Stannis Ulam]] had teleported the party to the Oosah logistics headquarters in [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]]. His intent was for the party to warn Oosah about the weapon while he and [[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh Teller]] rescue the rest of the resistance.

It's unlikely the party will need to prove their identity, but if you feel it is necessary, they should be plenty capable of proving their involvement in the resistance.

====== A Quick Break ======

**Teleportation Circle** equipped ships just left, so the party has two days to just chill while they get in position. Do as much or as little as you want!
