====== Ork Ridge ======

"Ork Ridge" is an adventure focused on the "what if?" of a Faerun going through an industrial and cultural revolution. Nationalistic governments seek to dominate the world, and talented magical talent is tapped to create horrible weapons. Levels 5-10 follow the players as they discover the creation of such a weapon, and try to stop its further development and use. Levels 11-15 then take the players, and the entire city they're in, to [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron]], where this city's mayor enlists them in securing the future of his people.

====== Changes to Faerun ======
===== Geopolitics =====

Traditional serfdoms and kingdoms no longer dominate the land, instead having recently been replaced by oligarchies, dictatorships, and in some rare cases, real democracy. Nations are no longer defined by race. Elves, Dwarves, and orcs can be found most anywhere. Bigotry is still rampant, but there are rarely groups of one race around anymore. It's just not economically sane anymore.

The three nations this adventure focuses on are: Esania, Gerbaut, and Oosah.
These nations are more or less the Faerun equivalents of WW2 France, Germany, and the USA. At the start of the adventure, Gerbaut is occupying Esania, and Oosah is preparing to "liberate" Esania.

==== Esania ====

Esanian territory stretches from the Reghed Glacier to just 50 miles North of [[wiki:orkridge:Waterdeep]], and just far enough East so to contain the entirety of the High Forest. Esania was the first functional democracy on all of Faerun, and was quite successful for it. It's capital is [[wiki:orkridge:Neverwinter]]. It is currently occupied by the Gerbaut.

==== Gerbaut ====

Due to a complex set of geopolitical constraints, the Gerbaut found imperial expansion necessary. The first nation they went for was Esania. Victory was rapid and decisive.

==== Oosah ====

A plutocratic federation of nations along the East coast of Faerun including Thay, Oosah is not happy about the Gerbaut having what amounts to a monopoly over the Northern Sword Coast. Esania must be liberated... for a price of course.

Oosah is home to [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]], that serves as a spot for the players to rest mentally from the war effort.

===== Technology =====

We have advanced into the industrial era. Steam power has revolutionized transportation. Steam rail connects particularly close economic centers at a whopping 30 miles per hour. Steam ships now dominate national navies, and have made their way into the commercial sector too.

The Bessemer process produces high quality steel at mind boggling prices. It's even being used for high rise construction in cities such as [[wiki:orkridge:Neverwinter]] where land is at a premium.

Firearms have made it possible for even the average militia to combat fully armored knights, though no self respecting marksman would be caught dead with one in their hands.

As the adventure unfolds, a number of radical advancements will be made, from repeating firearms, to electricity, and the horrible weapon being developed at Ork Ridge itself.

====== Adventure Chronology ======

===== Chapter 1 The Resistance=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_1]]

Levels 4-5

The adventure starts with the players heading to and exploring a cave dungeon. They stumble upon a Gerbaut secret weapon, and are embroiled in an [[wiki:orkridge:esania| Esanian]] resistance movement in Neverwinter, culminating in their hairy escape to The Oosahn city of New Elfington.

===== Chapter 2 New Elfington=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_2]]

Levels 7-8

Unfortunately, teleportation circle capable ships are not yet in position, so the party has some time in [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]], the capital of Oosah. There are numerous attractions in this city, including a reviving swing scene, a demolition derby, a powerful drug cartel, and the mysterious disappearance of the Warforged.

===== Chapter 3 Trek to the North Forest=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_3]]

Level 9

The big day of the liberation has come, and the party is to head behind enemy lines to find the resistance members, and get the location of the lab in which this weapon is built. This requires that they travel East to the [[wiki:orkridge:The Lost Peaks]], where resistance members are likely held in the Ghoulash. This plan likely takes them through war torn Neverwinter, Neverwinter Wood, Triboar, and finally the High Forest, where they find the Goulash and the Resistance.

===== Chapter 4 Ork Ridge=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_4]]

Level 9

Upon rescuing the captured Resistance members, they take refuge in a cave system in [[wiki:orkridge:the_lost_peaks]]. The nature of this strange geological formation is revealed to them, as is the location of Ork Ridge, the laboratory where the weapon was created. They must then deal with Eddard Teller's plans for this weapon.

===== Chapter 4.5 interlogue =====

The war isn't over. The Oosah has the upper hand, but the road ahead is a hard one. If the party want's to involve themselves in the rest of the war effort, they'll end up fighting in Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, the final bastions of the Gerbaut military. They will then enjoy some time off.

===== Chapter 5 The Financial Crash=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_5]]

Level 10

Post War Faerun is debt hungry, and after two years of what seems to be growth, the economy collapses.
