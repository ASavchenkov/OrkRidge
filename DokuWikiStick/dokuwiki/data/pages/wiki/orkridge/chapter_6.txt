[[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] was teleported to Eberron, specifically into the heart of the Mournland. The good news is that much like [[wiki:orkridge:the Lost Peaks]], the ground level of New Elfington is higher than the ground level of where it was teleported to, about 1 KM above, meaning the inhabitants of the city are safe from the Gray Mist.

Far away, at [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Arythawn_Keep | Arythawn Keep]], Thranian scout officer [[wiki:orkridge:Ogma Fronis]] is called to the watchtower.

"What the fuck.... Tira Miron above..."

"Sound the alarm. Send animal messengers to Vathirond and Aruldsk. Tell Vathirond to fortify for an unknown threat, and to send for help. The Mournland is... moving."

An eagle makes it to Vathirond, reaching a human. That human relays the message, and just barely makes it on the train headed to Starilaskur. When she gets there, she immediately passes the information on to an elven mage that casts sending to a military official in Sharn.

====== New Elfington ======

It is only to the East that anyone can see land not covered in this Gray Mist.

The contingent of Oosah military that happened to be in New Elfington, led by Dron at the time rapidly institutes martial law. Citizens are obviously terrified of what happened. Leosh Teller and his crew are jailed for terrorism, and Dron enlists the party in taking on dangerous tasks.

===== Vagrants and Activists =====


The first is to deal with some rioters that have taken over food stores and taken hostages. He's reluctant to send the military in. The gang believes that the government will not ration food fairly.

===== Explore the Mist =====

Dron wants to know everything he possibly can about the mist below. Is it dangerous? How deep does it go? What's underneath it? He tasks the party with discovering all of this.

===== First Contact =====

On the second day, an airship is spotted North-East of the city. It seems to be headed right for them. This is a house of the Lyrandar airship sent by the nation of [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Thrane | Thrane]]. Within hours a second airship is spotted behind and to the South of it. This one was sent by [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Breland | Breland]]. Both border the Mournland, and both want to claim domain over whatever the hell is happening here. Other nations will follow, but their spies have yet to hear of this development.

The ships arrive nearly at the same time, and the leaders, Nicole Zeph and Keira Cane are both are mostly civil towards each other, but each primarily ignores the other's claim to any authority, which obviously produces some tension. If things come to a boil, both manage to cool themselves off, and report the situation to their superiors. Rather suspiciously, after this happens, they're both suddenly on the same page.

What actually happened is that they both got instructions from their corporate overlord [[wiki:orkridge:Laurens Ir'Tain]] to work together and bring the discussion to Sharn, where economic interests can better exploit the situation.

New Elfington will temporarily be considered sovereign. During that time period, it needs to send envoys to Sharn to discuss this event with officials from each nation.

====== Murder on the Lighting Rail ======
==== (Optional) ====

The party is taken by airship to the nearest train station, at which point they transfer to a Lightning Rail. During this transfer, the party is swarmed with reporters. One manages to sneak a bug into the armor of the most important looking party member.


This train is not only carrying passengers, but also some precious cargo, a clone for the fabulously wealthy [[wiki:orkridge:laurens_ir_tain| Laurens ir'Tain]]. This clone is a target for an agent of House Thuranni, who wishes to sabotage it to get more leverage over Laurens. See [[wiki:orkridge:Plot Against Laurens]].

====== Sharn ======


Sharn is... huge, specifically tall. It's a full 2km high at the tip of its grounded towers, and another kilometer up to the top of the floating towers.

The party arrives at Terminus station, Sharn, and is immediately escorted to "The Cornerstone" in "Middle Tavick's Landing."

"Your accomodations have been taken care of, a gesture of goodwill from house Ghallanda. The hearings and meetings will begin tomorrow."

===== Activities in Eberron=====

[[wiki:orkridge:eberron#Cool Spots|Sharn]] has a little bit of anything for anyone, and is meant to be the "home base" for the players. Any activity that the player characters want to partake in can probably be found in one of its districts. If it can't be found, you can at least take a train to an easily accessible city that does.

==== Research ====

One thing that mages might want to do is research the magic that caused New Elfington to teleport here, (or of course anything else). Morgrave University has an incredibly stocked library, though it's focus has less to do with arcana and more with distant lands, planets, and history. Most books have been scavenged from fires during the war, and both authors and experts are often dead. Players are unlikely to find direct answers to their questions about particularly powerful magic there.

For this purpose, they likely need to travel to [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_University_of_Wynarn |The University of Wynarn]].
==== The Race of Eight Winds ====

Sharn is known in particular for it's penchant for extreme sports. One that's coming up in particular is the [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Race_of_Eight_Winds| Race of Eight Winds]], modified from the canonical form to be far more inclusive to participants. It's also not strictly legal, though no law enforcement agency dares, or even wants to, interfere.

Anyone and Everyone can join. This aerial race runs through the entire city of Sharn, with progress measured by magical rings that contestants have to pass through. It begins and ends in the highest towers.

=== Rules ===

Individual contestants join one of eight teams, and pay what they want into a pot, with a minimum entry fee of 200 GP. The first individual to cross the finish line wins the pot for their team, and a little something for themselves. This encourages teamwork.

The "Little Something" for first place is a blank scroll of 8th level. This is a scroll that replicates the ability of the 9th level spell "Wish" to replicate the effects of any 8th level spell.
