====== Altered Cats ======

I paraphrase Virgil: //I write of Cyberpunk, and the Cat.//

This plot is basically entirely lifted from the book "Altered Carbon," with the plot of "Cats" integrated. I figured it was a fantastic fit for the Eberron universe. It is a side plot and is not actually integral to the Ork Ridge plot, but it's still fun for people who appreciate mysteries.

===== Background =====

The wealthy aristocracy of the Skyway have plenty of vices, but none are quite as frowned upon in this city as bestiality. intermarriage of humans/elves/dwarves with Tabaxi and the like is still illegal here, and sexual relations between the two races are frowned upon in the public sphere. Weird and racist, but you know the saying: //"<del>Science</del> Society advances one funeral at a time."//

Enter [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals|Rei d'Thuranni]], current leader of house **Thuranni**. The rich have their tastes, but need to be satisfied discreetly. Rei gets Tabaxi to her high altitude zeppelin in the "Heaviside Layer", where, willing or not, they service Rei's wealthy clients.

Griz(abella) was one that was unwilling, and actually escaped, plummeting into **The Hilt**, and finally washing ashore. Rei forged a religious document stating that Griz was "Anti Necromancy," and thus not to be raised or spoken to.

===== Resolution 69,420 =====

**Rei** asks **Laurens** to kill the resolution allowing **Speak With Dead** to be cast even on those with religious objections, but he refuses, so his wife **Celyria** helps **Rei** enchant him to crave the cats. He goes to **Heavyside Layer** and afterwards feels so weirded out that he kills himself to forget.

===== Where the Party Steps In =====

  * **Laurens** wants them to find out who killed him, as he doesn't think he would kill himself.
  * **Celyria** wants them to come up with a fake conclusion to cover for her enchanting him.

As they investigate, they find that Laurens has been traveling to **Lower Dura** quite often, and trace his tracks to a clan of **Tabaxi** living in **Fallen**
