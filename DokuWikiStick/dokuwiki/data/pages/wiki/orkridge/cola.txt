====== COLA ======

Grad students at the **Arcane Congress** in **Aundair: Arcanix**, want a **Cost Of Living Adjustment**. Negotiations have not been going in their favor so far, in fact, the Arcane Congress has rejected all offers to negotiate.

===== Introductions =====


[[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh Teller]], in his travels, visits a bar in **Arcanix**, looking to get friendly with some researchers. He gets lucky and overhears some students talking about  **COLA** and joins their table.

//"Greetings fellow mages."//

//"Bit young to call yourself a mage are you?"//

//"Bit young to be in this bar too. Looks can be deceiving. I couldn't help but overhear your conversation."//

//"Aah, so the Pinkertons are sending child soldiers now?"//

//"To the contrary. I'm not from here"//

//"No shit"//

//"You've heard of New Elfington, yes? Here, let me throw a hypothetical at you."//

//"A man breaks into your home with a knife, and robs you blind. You've called the watch and they said it was all on the straight and narrow. He does this twice a month. One day, you get tired and buy a shotgun. When he breaks the door down you blast him dead, and somehow you're the bad guy?"//

//"What I'm saying is your public image is... misleading. Revolutionaries always have a reputation for being aggressors, when in fact they're just fighting in self defense. They're telling you it's just business. Well, let's do business with them. I think it's time you balance the books a bit.//

This argument works on the grad students. **Leosh's** idea is to steal the materials necessary to build another device.

//"Can't remember where I heard this. 'If you want justice, you'll have to claw it from them', do damage, be dangerous. Make them take you seriously. Give them no other choice."//

Leosh quotes **Quellcrist Falconer**, from **Altered Carbon**, but he's not sure where he's heard it before.
==== Make it Personal ====

A Pinkerton spy was watching the whole exchange, and follows the students and Leosh to one of their homes, where they continue discussions.

The Pinkerton manages to break in, but is caught by a **Snare**. Leosh brings the group to face this intruder, who even has weapons, the point being that the Pinkertons are already moving on them, and the only option is to strike quickly and decisively.

//Remember. You make it personal, otherwise the creatures of power slide from under the machinery of justice with a wink and a grin.//

and he casts **Feeblemind** on the Pinkerton. This shocks the students, as it's an incredibly high level spell, but also incredibly cruel. Leosh then lets the Pinkerton out onto the street, to be found by the authorities in the morning.

==== Bluff? ====

Leosh Teller, Eddard Teller, and the grad students have heisted the materials, and finish construction of the device while law enforcement struggles to breach the lab and stop them.

//"There. It is done."//

//"Are you sure they won't call our bluff?"//

//"...Bluff?"//

It is at this point that the students realize that this isn't just a scare tactic. This is the real deal.

Leosh makes an announcement in his Char Marks outfit.

//"The COLA movement means no ill will in the construction of 'The Device'. We seek simply to protect ourselves, to level the playing field upon which the trodden upon bargain for their livelihoods. I've been made aware of the fact that the COLA movement has crossed boundaries, and inflamed the passions of laborers all around Khorvaire. We support this expansion. Discuss and bargain in good faith. That is all."//

==== Proliferation ====

The exploitation of the lower class is a well known phenomenon in most industrialized societies, even to those who are being exploited. Those who are being exploited rightfully believe that they don't have the power to fight this phenomenon in many cases.

And here comes **Char Marks**, quoting JFK (unbeknownst even to him): //"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."//

And he has a WMD, and the governments of the world are finally //listening//.

The message is clear. The lower classes have tried a peaceful revolution, and it was made impossible, so it is time for a violent revolution.

==== Sharn ====

Sharn is the first city to experience a literal uprising from the lower wards.
Protests start peaceful, but escalate as the Sharn Watch doesn't want to allow protests to leave the lower wards (a decision of questionable legality).

Over time the Sharn Watch are pushed back until the streets in the middle wards swarm with protesters (and rioters).

The Sharn watch is extra aggressive in stopping the crowds from entering the upper wards, and deploy **Stinking Cloud** canisters on them. This is precisely the excuse that some in the crowd were looking for to use their home-made firebombs. At this point the watch scatters and the crowds march on the governmental buildings in **Upper Central**

//Do it.//

//Is this a direct order?//

//Don't look darling.//

//What do you mean?//

//I mean that I have no choice in what is about to happen.//

And the Sharn Watch deploys **Sickening Radiance** (Sarin Gas), killing hundreds. [[wiki:notable_individuals#Iyanna ir'Talan]] is shocked, and immediately turns in her badge and sidearm, taking an elevator to the lower wards.

//You always have a choice//
