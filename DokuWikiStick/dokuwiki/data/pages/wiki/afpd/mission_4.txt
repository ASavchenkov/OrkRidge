====== State of the Union ======

  * Bablo Bigasso is dead, and the media has accepted that he was the Pepsi killer.
  * An LAPD investigator is suspicious of the circumstances under which he died, and is investigating.
    *Notable is the fact that Bablo was shot twice
    *That the Fantasy Coke and money were left there, and that he had way too little money for the amount of coke.
    *That Bablo had no prior connections to the drug trade.
  *The LAPD drone think has gone real bad by now.


====== Flash Forward ======

We flash forward, and the characters are no longer in LA. They're in Eberron, specifically [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#Notable Locations| Sharn]]. Their task is to build a rapport with the locals, that way when a certain group of individuals (The [[wiki:orkridge:Orkridge]] party) appears in the city, they can slowly incept certain ideas in their minds (that they're living in a simulation, and that there may be a way out.)

====== The Opportunity ======

Solve the [[wiki:orkridge:Plot Against Laurens]]. He's heard of some newcomers who operate... differently, and he wants to hire them for the job.
