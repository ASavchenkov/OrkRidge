Here we try to build a tactical combat system that works with any PBTA system. Core principles are:
  
  * Start and end with the fiction
    * The player say's what they want to do.
    * Discuss what move describes this best.
    * Roll Dice.
    * Resolve
  * [2d6 + MOD] roll when making a move.
  * Modularity. It should be possible to plug this into any PBTA system.
  * precision and simplicity in everything: Effects, movement, and status.
  * GM continues not to roll dice. Combat turns end up being chess like where certain characters could potentially move more often than others.
  * Successes should provide real advantages that, depending on circumstance outweigh the risks.

An individual or team advantage (abstract) should primarily vest as more options, some of which may be more powerful, but niche and difficult to access.

====== GM Moves ======

In tactical gameplay, the opponents options and actions should to a certain extent be predictable.

If a player rolls a failure, the GM can make a move as normal. The "hardness" of the move made is dependent on the options fictionally available to the GM. If the players have, either through clever thinking or good luck, gained a fictionally advantageous position, the set of moves available to the GM shrinks. A cuffed bad guy probably can't stab you. First they have to pick the lock. The GM should make the move that makes the most sense. Combat should to a certain extent be //**predictable**//.

The below are merely examples of options the GM might prepare or improvise on the spot for enemies or the encounter:

  * **Have someone attack:** They have weapons, and the player has made themselves vulnerable in fiction somehow. Apply harm as defined by the fiction.
  * **Unstable environment:** An explosion might cause a rockfall, a herd of animals might be bearing down on the players.
  * **Bad Luck:** The grenade bounces just right to go in the wrong direction. You're assassinating someone in a crowd of civilians and miss. Use sparingly.
====== Player Moves ======

These are moves that everyone has by default:

  * **Get it Done:**: Any fiction that is better described by the base PbtA moves. Simply use the original system rules for this action.
  * **Run for it:**: Move four units with some objective in mind. This might be cover, escape, or an item. What this objective is determines appropriate GM responses.
  * **Tackle:** On a success, the only move the target can do is escape.
    * **Mixed** Now you're both on the ground. The only action you can take is to escape.
  * **Hide:** You've gotten to cover, or gotten out of their sight.
    * **Success:** Take +1 to your next move.
    * **Mixed:** Choose one of the below.


====== Weapons ======

Combat is mostly carried out through the use of weapons, whether it be firearms, swords, pikes, bows, laser guns, or even fists.
These are generic moves when a more specific one from the weapon doesn't apply.

  * **Any Ranged Weapon:**
    * **Success:** Target takes n harm. and/or special effect of weapon.
    * **Mixed:** Choose one of the below.
      * **Flesh Wound:** In your hurry you just winged them. Decrease harm by 1.
      * **Gunfight:** You got the shot, and someone else got the shot on you.
      * **Vulnerable:** You spent too long lining the shot up. Someone moved into position. Their next move will //inflict terrible harm (+1 harm)//

* **Any Melee Weapon:**
    * **Success:** Target takes n harm. and/or special effect of weapon.
    * **Mixed:** Choose one of the below.
      * **Everybody gets cut:** Before you got them, they got you.
      * **Disarmed:** Sure you got them, but your knife is all the way over there now.
      * **On the Ground:** No one got cut, but you're both vulnerable now...


  * **AOE:** **Success:** The targets take n harm.
    * **Mixed:** The GM makes a soft move. Examples include:
      * **Practice Throwing:** the AOE actually lands in an adjacent square of the GMs choosing.
      * **Telegraphed:** They saw it coming from a mile away. Everyone managed to get down. reduce harm by -1.
