====== Foreign Relations ======

The delegation has had its fun, but now it needs to get to business.

===== Heated Debate =====

The party is invited to the highest towers to begin the hearings. Everyone has something they want out of the situation, including New Elfington, hence the entourage they sent.

  * [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] just wants to get the city back home where it was.
  * **New Cyre** believes new Elfington to be the promised land. A city within Cyre, safe from the Gray mist. They actually want to emigrate there and start fighting against the Gray Mist.
  * **Breland** wants to set up businesses there and make a lot of profit off of looting Cyre beneath the Mist.
  * **Thrane**: The Sacred Flame claims this to be the work of evil forces. No one is to be let in or out until they have deemed the situation stable and free of demonic influence.
  * **Aundair** just wants to send its people to New Elfington to do some research.
  * **Everyone** puts 2 and 2 together at some point, and realizes that the "devices" used in the war were not purely destructive. They teleport to potentially livable places. The rush is on to rediscover this technology, and use it for both military and civil purposes.
