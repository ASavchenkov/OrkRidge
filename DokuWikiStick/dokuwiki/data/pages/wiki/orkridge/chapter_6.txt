[[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] was teleported to [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron]], specifically into the heart of the Mournland, next to [[wiki:orkridge:Kalazart]]. The good news is that much like [[wiki:orkridge:the Lost Peaks]], the ground level of New Elfington is higher than the ground level of where it was teleported to, about 1 KM above, meaning the inhabitants of the city are safe from the Gray Mist.

Far away, at [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Arythawn_Keep | Arythawn Keep]], Thranian scout officer [[wiki:orkridge:Ogma Fronis]] is called to the watchtower.

"What the fuck.... Tira Miron above..."

"Sound the alarm. Send animal messengers to Vathirond and Aruldsk. Tell Vathirond to fortify for an unknown threat, and to send for help. The Mournland is... moving."

An eagle makes it to Aruldsk, an owl to Vathirond. In Vathirond, a Brelish spy overhears the talk of the town, and barely makes it on the train headed to Starilaskur. When she gets there, she immediately passes the information on to an elven mage that casts sending to a military official in Sharn.

====== New Elfington ======

It is only to the West that anyone can see land not covered in this Gray Mist, and even then it is so far on the horizon that one might think it to be a hallucination.

The contingent of Oosah military that happened to be in New Elfington, led by Dron at the time rapidly institutes martial law. Citizens are obviously terrified of what happened. Leosh Teller escapes and his crew is jailed for terrorism, and Dron enlists the party in taking on dangerous tasks.


===== Effects of Eberron on Faerunians =====

Eberron is a more advanced simulation. It has slightly different physics, graphical processing, kinematics. These minute differences in the linkage between the mind of an individual and the world around it cause problems for the mind. Some can adapt, as the Warforged did, while others suffer increasingly horrible mental damage over the months to come.

The very first pieces of this information should be hinted at while they're still in new Elfington, but the first real alarm should be raised when they're already in Sharn.

  - First some minor difficulty focusing.
  - A minor headache.
  - Nausea.
  - Splitting migranes
  - Loss of coordination.
  - Various madnesses.
===== Children on the Edge =====

At some point the party likely gets to the edge of the plateau. They notice some children pretty close to the edge.

A DC 15 Survival check reveals that this section of cliff is unstable, and going to fall over at any moment.
A DC 15 Perception check reveals to the players that some cracking noise is happening underneath. This gives them even less time to save the kids though.

===== Vagrants and Activists =====


The first is to deal with some rioters that have taken over food stores and taken hostages. He's reluctant to send the military in. The gang believes that the government will not ration food fairly.

===== Explore the Mist =====

Dron wants to know everything he possibly can about the mist below. Is it dangerous? How deep does it go? What's underneath it? He tasks the party with discovering all of this.

==== Effects of the Mist on Players ====
Every 10 minutes spent in the mist require a constitution saving throw of DC 17 against this poisonous mist. On a failure, the character takes 2d6 poison damage, and rolls on the "Short Term Madness" table.

On the third failure, players roll on the long term madness table instead.

Features or items that interact with inhaled poison work normally. (Such as dwarven poison resistance.)

==== Steam Powered Giraffe ====

When the party reaches the ground and begins exploring, the first thing they notice is the silhouette of a giraffe. A perception check reveals more about the situation.

  * DC 15: The giraffe seems to be exhaling some steam.
  * DC 19, or very close observation: The giraffe seems to consist of both meat and metal, combined in unholy matrimony.
  * DC 23: A giant Displacer Beast is crouched in the brush, ready to pounce on the giraffe.
  * DC 25: This displacer beast is also covered in metal much like the giraffe.

The party also makes a group stealth roll.

  * DC 25: Neither animal notices the players.
  * DC 22: The Displacer Beast takes note of them and circles around to ambush them instead.
  * DC 18: The giraffe also notices them, turns, and strikes a defensive pose.

The Giraffe has an AC of 17, while the Displacer Beast's AC has been increased to 18. These high AC's are a result of this new meatal armor that they seem to both have. The displacer beast has double the hit dice and it's size goes up by 1.

==== The Town of Kalazart====

A road ends in the cliff face, and extends westwards. This road leads through a ringed city. Entering the city along this road takes them through:
  - Lower income housing.
  - Wealthy housing,
  - Warehouses and manufacturing.
  - The central market.

Potential soundtrack during narration: **Snarky Puppy; Even Us**.

By pure coincidence, a group of warforged operating under the command of the [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_Blades| Lord of Blades]] returns from a scouting expedition to determine what's going on with this new geological phenomenon that just appeared out of nowhere.

If the party manages to stay hidden, they can observe the warforged as they enter a warehouse/factory. They are reporting back to the **Lord of Blades** along what seems to be a landline going South. Their message is to mobilize an aerial scout to **Kalazart**
===== First Contact =====

On the second day, an airship is spotted North-East of the city. It seems to be headed right for them. This is a house of the Lyrandar airship sent by the nation of [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Thrane | Thrane]]. Within hours a second airship is spotted behind and to the South of it. This one was sent by [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Breland | Breland]]. Both border the Mournland, and both want to claim domain over whatever the hell is happening here. Other nations will follow, but their spies have yet to hear of this development.

The ships arrive nearly at the same time, and the leaders, Nicole Zeph and Keira Cane are both are mostly civil towards each other, but each primarily ignores the other's claim to any authority, which obviously produces some tension. If things come to a boil, both manage to cool themselves off, and report the situation to their superiors. Rather suspiciously, after this happens, they're both suddenly on the same page.

What actually happened is that they both got instructions from their corporate overlord [[wiki:orkridge:Laurens Ir'Tain]] to work together and bring the discussion to Sharn, where economic interests can better exploit the situation.

New Elfington will temporarily be considered sovereign. During that time period, it needs to send envoys to Sharn to discuss this event with officials from each nation.

====== Murder on the Lighting Rail ======
**(Optional)**

The party is taken by airship to the nearest train station, at which point they transfer to a Lightning Rail. During this transfer, the party is swarmed with reporters. One manages to sneak a bug into the armor of the most important looking party member.


This train is not only carrying passengers, but also some precious cargo the identity of which is not revealed to the party. It is a clone for the fabulously wealthy [[wiki:orkridge:laurens_ir_tain| Laurens ir'Tain]]. This clone is a target for an agent of House Thuranni, who wishes to sabotage it to get more leverage over Laurens. See [[wiki:orkridge:Plot Against Laurens]].

The first sign that something is wrong is when this agent falls into a catatonic state as the result of the spell **Magic Jar**. It would be hard to identify this spell however, because the magic jar is not on his person, but in his room.

The agent then possesses another passenger, slowly maneuvering him to the back of the carriage so that when the deed is done this stranger is under suspicion, until he finally releases the stranger back into his body, and projects his soul into the body of Lauren[[wiki:orkridge:laurens_ir_tain]].

It is at this point that he attempts to either escape with the clone, or kill it, returning to his body.

====== Dream With Thin Anthony Hopkins ======

The PCs are together in a white space with Thin Anthony Hopkins in front of them with a clipboard. Though he looks no different than he did before, his gait and overall demeanor betrays that he is very tired and anxious.

"Alright, please list your symptoms." He's referring to the symptoms displayed by those in New Elfington, but the players are not experiencing them.

"Hmm. You're saying you feel fine? The world around you doesn't send your head spinning? No nausea, vertigo, migranes?" After their response, he thinks for a time.

"A man feeds birds in a park. Find him. He will make you an offer that is very easy to refuse. Do not. It might be the only way of keeping all of this going." If pushed:
"Your world, your way of life, exists at the behest of apathetic bottom feeders who haven't the slightest understanding of what it is or what it means." A timer on his wrist counts down to 5 seconds. "I'm out of time. Find the man. He'll be wearing a big hat."
====== Sharn ======

{{wiki:sharn2.jpg}}

Sharn is... huge, specifically tall. It's a full 2km high at the tip of its grounded towers, and another kilometer up to the top of the floating towers. Beside that, it's also 7 km in diameter.

//**Soundtrack Suggestion: Big Ugly, by Snarky Puppy**//

The party arrives at Terminus station, Sharn. Here the doors open to **Commander Iyanna ir'Talan** circling with 4 **Boromar** henchmen. The players may intervene at any point during the following exchange:

"You're going to leave the dreamer and the money with my deputies, then you're going to leave."
"Just cause we know your daddy don't mean we won't kill you right here."
"The four of you'll be dead before you even clear your weapons, and you see this badge? That's gonna make it legal. Lets try this again. You're going to leave the dreamer and the money with my deputies, then you're going to leave."

The henchmen mull it over a bit, drop their duffel bags, and start slowly backing away, only turning around to start jogging after clearing 30 ft. At precisely this time two half-elf guards arrive on the scene, pick the duffel bags up, and stand at attention.

"Welcome to our charming city travelers." she says as she puts out her hand, expecting a handshake.


and is immediately escorted to **The Cornerstone** in **Middle Tavick's Landing**. after having been assailed by paparazzi. 

"Your accommodations have been taken care of, a gesture of goodwill from house Ghallanda. The hearings will begin tomorrow."

===== A Night on the Town =====

The party should be completely settled in by about 4PM, and the hearings start at 9AM the next day, so the characters have some time to rest and party. All of the relevant material for activities in Sharn is best written in the ERTLW sourcebook. Only one event is important to the story.

==== Sky Race ====

They notice some people setting up "Airspace Closed" signs, but they look like hooligans. These hooligans are setting up for a street race, a warm up of sorts for the [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)]].

  * If they follow these hooligans, they get to a classic Fast and Furious car meet with scantily clad people of all races and genders, and sleek modded skycoaches.
  * If they don't, four of these modded skycoaches blast past them, requiring a dex saving throw to get out of the way or get knocked off the bridge. Refer to ERTLW tables for falling off of bridges.

If they're particularly perceptive or active, they notice a man in a tall hat ([[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#Broham Lincoln]]) get on a larger skycoach. During the practice race he does an extremely dangerous maneuver (up to interpretation) and his crew quits.

Conversation with the participants reveal why the [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)]] is so important. The prize is a blank 8th level spell scroll, anything you want.

=== The Racers ===

  * **Broham Lincoln:** Runs one of the larger machines. Minimum crew of 4 (including him)
    * Pilot and Co-pilot, gunner and boarding crew.
  * **Bon the Wizard:** An undercover member of the blackened book who prefers to do his investigations up close and personal.
    * Crew of two burly goons with a well hidden intelligence.
  * **Doris Boromar:** Runs a sky-cycle alone.
    * Very fast and hard to hit, exclusively uses a regular long-sword if violence is necessary.
  * **Dia and Dillon:** Two Gnomes who operate what seems to literally be a flying saucer. 
    * They're newcomers to the whole illegal street racing thing, but they're both talented pilots, and their saucer has a number of ingenious features.
    * **Reactive Armor:** If a powerful projectile makes contact with the vehicle, it blows up and destroys it. One use on each of the 4 sides.
    * **Camouflage:** It's not invisible, but you're not quite sure //exactly// where it is.
    * **Sleeper Smoke:** Open Cockpits beware, if they're ahead of you, you might end up napping.

=== The Race ===

This race takes place exclusively in Tavicks landing. It starts and ends in Lower Tavicks Landing, traveling vertically through middle and upper Tavicks Landing, before making it's way back down the other side.

  * **Starting Straight**:
    * Regular drag race start. The first complication is that as soon as they start, a large amount of garbage is falling towards you.
  * **Upward Straight**:
    * bridges and parapets regularly need to be dodged. **Bon the Wizard** decides to test the mettle of the newcomers and casts a spell at them.
  * **Upper Tavicks Landing Straight**:
    * They blast through one of the richer portions of Upper Tavicks landing, causing trouble for some of the currently shopping residents.
    * As they make the turn for the bottom straight, they blow past a Sharn Watch Skycoach, and a chase is initiated.
  * **Downward Straight**:
    * Falling isn't really an issue here, since you can always just get back on your own machine. the trouble is dodging the bridges and skycoaches.
    * Anyone who is falling behind starts getting aggressive with their less than legal techniques.
  * Escape: Who crosses the finish line first isn't really important. It's about who gets away from the watch.
==== Lincoln Park ====

This is when they realize that the plaza their hotel faces is actually **Lincoln Park**, with a statue and plaque of [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#Broham Lincoln]]. They find a man with a tall hat feeding birds, and upon a second look, he and the statue look very similar. Broham speaks first to anyone who looks like they've done a lot of fighting. He assumes any and all Warforged fought in the war.

"How did you do it? How did you go back to civvie life after that shit?"

After this conversation takes its course, he asks them to join his [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)|Baka R]] team, and the players remember their dream with Thin Anthony Hopkins.
===== Heated Debate =====

The party is invited to the highest towers to begin the hearings. Everyone has something they want out of the situation, including New Elfington, hence the entourage they sent.

  * [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] just wants to get the city back home where it was.
  * **New Cyre** believes new Elfington to be the promised land. A city within Cyre, safe from the Gray mist. They actually want to emigrate there and start fighting against the Gray Mist.
  * **Breland** wants to set up businesses there and make a lot of profit off of looting Cyre beneath the Mist.
  * **Thrane**: The Sacred Flame claims this to be the work of evil forces. No one is to be let in or out until they have deemed the situation stable and free of demonic influence.
  * **Aundair** just wants to send its people to New Elfington to do some research.
  * **Everyone** puts 2 and 2 together at some point, and realizes that the "devices" used in the war were not purely destructive. They teleport to potentially livable places. The rush is on to rediscover this technology, and use it for both military and civil purposes.
