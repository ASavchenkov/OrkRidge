The Oosah have secured Neverwinter, or it has been wiped off of the map. Either way, the war is very much on. The Oosah still need to take Waterdeep, and then finally Baldur's Gate.


==== Invading Baldur's Gate ====

Unbeknownst to the Oosah, a new long range artillery system is in place at Baldur's Gate, trained on any navy that might want to get within naval bombardment range. This is codified as a "Planetary Defense" force asset in SWN. The Gerbaut have purchased stealth for this asset. It is used to defend against any naval attack.

In my game, the Oosah do indeed destroy the Gerbaut without needing any assistance, thought it comes at great material cost. Their "Blockade Fleet" is destroyed, their mercenaries scattered, and their funds depleted.

==== Trouble at Home ====

What's worse is the growing unrest at home, as the Labour party clashes with the Banking Trust LTD. It is at this time that it becomes highly appropriate for the players to start their own factions if they wish, and to involve themselves in this conflict.
