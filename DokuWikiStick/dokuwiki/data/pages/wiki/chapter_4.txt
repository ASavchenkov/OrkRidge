====== The "Lost Peaks" ======

The western face of the "Lost Peaks" is occupied by a small group of wood elves. When their villages were raided by orks in one of the last racial wars, some managed to hide and make it out alive. They spend a year as nomads in their own home, ambushing, terrorizing, in general being enough of a pain in the ass. Then, the "Lost Peaks" appeared. Just like that, where there used to be forest, there was now an enormous plateau. Immediately realizing the strategic advantage of such a formation, they traveled to, and up it, and what they found was a group of [[wiki:Warforged|Warforged]], and a number of lizardfolk corpses bearing a foreign military. Most seemed to be badly damaged, to the point of not being operable, but some seem to be in fighting shape. Upon reconciling their positions and histories, they agree to work together to form a defensible position.
