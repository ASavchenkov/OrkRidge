=== Quotes Lifted From Westworld ===

  * I read a theory once that the human intellect was like peacock feathers. Just an extravagant display intended to attract a mate. All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart, William Shakespeare, Michelangelo, and the Empire State Building. Just an elaborate mating ritual. Maybe it doesn’t matter that we have accomplished so much for the basest of reasons. But, of course, the peacock can barely fly. It lives in the dirt, pecking insects out of the muck, consoling itself with its great beauty.
  * Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool… The mistake.
  * You can’t play God without being acquainted with the devil.
  * Everything in this world is magic, except to the magician.
  * I’ve told you, [Bernard]. Never place your trust in us. We’re only human. Inevitably, we will disappoint you.
