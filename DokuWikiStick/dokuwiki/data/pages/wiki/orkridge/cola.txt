====== COLA ======

Grad students at the **Arcane Congress** in **Aundair: Arcanix**, want a **Cost Of Living Adjustment**. Negotiations have not been going in their favor so far, in fact, the Arcane Congress has rejected all offers to negotiate.

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh Teller]], in his travels, visits a bar in **Arcanix**, looking to get friendly with some researchers. He gets lucky and overhears some students talking about  **COLA** and joins their table.

//"Greetings fellow mages."//

//"Bit young to call yourself a mage are you?"//

//"Bit young to be in this bar too. Looks can be deceiving. I couldn't help but overhear your conersation."//

//"Aah, so the Pinkertons are sending child soldiers now?"//

//"To the contrary. I'm not from here"//

//"No shit"//

//"You've heard of New Elfington, yes? Here, let me throw a hypothetical at you."//

//"A man breaks into your home with a knife, and robs you blind. You've called the watch and they said it was all on the straight and narrow. He does this twice a month. One day, you get tired and buy a shotgun. When he breaks the door down you blast him dead, and somehow you're the bad guy?"//

//"What I'm saying is your public image is... misleading. Revolutionaries always have a reputation for being aggressors, when in fact they're just fighting in self defense. They're telling you it's just business. Well, let's do business with them. I think it's time you balance the books a bit.//

This argument works on the grad students. **Leosh's** idea is to steal the materials necessary to build another device.

//"Can't remember where I heard this. 'If you want justice, you'll have to claw it from them', do damage, be dangerous. Make them take you seriously. Give them no other choice."//
