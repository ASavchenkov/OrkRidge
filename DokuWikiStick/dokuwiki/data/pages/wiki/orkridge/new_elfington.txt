====== New Elfington ======

This is the city the party ends up in after escaping [[wiki:orkridge:Neverwinter]].

====== Factions ======

Numerous groups are vying for control, or simply trying to survive in this city.

===== Duads =====

A large criminal organization primarily focused on illegal drugs, the Duads have recently been making big profits off of [some new drug]. In my case it was **powdered gold**.

This drug is so popular during wartime that they even start branching out into music. They've been looking to acquire the [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington#Swing Sisters]], but they've not been receptive to the Duads business propositions.

===== Swing Sisters =====

A band consisting of [[wiki:notable_individuals#Jackie Swing]], [[wiki:notable_individuals#Ellie Swing]], as well as a complement of talented musicians from their long gone past. They're looking to do one last gig to pay their old churches taxes and save it.

===== Warforged =====

With the ability to cheaply resurrect Warforged, 
====== Notable Locations ======

The first place the party visits. It's a pyramidal structure with some modest dormitories that the party might make use of depending on the relationship they build with [[wiki:notable_individuals#The General]] and [[wiki:notable_individuals#Dron]].

===== Theater =====

Where the party might go to relax and see a show, potentially the **Swing Sisters** reunion show.

===== Derby Arena =====

An enormous arena used to stage highly violent demolition derbies.

===== Duad Hideout =====

A hideout that the Duads stage their operations from.
