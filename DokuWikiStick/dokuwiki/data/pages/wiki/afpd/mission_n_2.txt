[[wiki:afpd:corps#Kamen Korp]] has been dumping battery manufacturing byproducts in the LA river. They've managed to get away with this thanks to the corruption of **Scotty Catlow**, mayor of LA. An overall sense of disillusion means that while his work has long since been exposed, he is still in power thanks to corporate propaganda and the small size of the community this issue affects.

**Sam Seaborn**, mentioned this issue offhand to the party, and they offered to kill **Scotty**. **Sam** begrudgingly accepts, noting that he won't be able to help them much financially.

===== The Target =====

==== Nighttime ====

**Scotty Catlow** resides in a luxurious home just below **Griffith Observatory**. He has a security detail of approximately 8 at night, and his home is wired up with sensor networks and automated defenses, as he has recently been the target of numerous attacks.

==== Daytime ====

On Sundays he has a weekly game of **Gwent** with some of his buddies at the **Pacific Palisades**. His security detail follows him, and some of his... accomplices? have their own smaller details. They may take some time off the game to go to the beach nearby.
