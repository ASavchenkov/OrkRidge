====== Baka R ======

Technically **The Race of the Eight Winds**

Sharn is known in particular for it's penchant for extreme sports. One that's coming up in particular is the [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Race_of_Eight_Winds| Race of Eight Winds]], modified from the canonical form to be far more inclusive to participants, and much more grueling. It is known colloquially as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar|Baka Race]] since only idiots would participate. It's also not strictly legal, though no law enforcement agency dares, or even wants to, interfere.

Anyone and Everyone can join. This aerial race runs through the entire continent of Eberron, starting in the Mror Holds, and ending in the Highest Towers of Sharn.

===== Rules =====

==== Entry and Pot ====

Individual contestants join one of eight teams, and pay what they want into a pot, with a minimum entry fee of 200 GP. The first individual to cross the finish line wins the pot for their team, and a little something for themselves. This, and the fact that the race takes an entire week, encourages teamwork.

The "Little Something" for first place is a blank scroll of 8th level. This is a scroll that replicates the ability of the 9th level spell "Wish" to replicate the effects of any 8th level spell.

==== Coopertition ====

//"You've ne'er done one of these before have you? If word gets out that I didn't stop to help you, no one's gonna stop to help me when I have trouble. A whole  week of this... It's guaranteed to happen. No, the big booms only start when you get close to the finish line. That's why they have the final stretch go through Sharn."
//

This may come into play outside of **Korth** and in **The Demon Wastes**.
===== Roadbook =====

The route contestants need to take is given to them the day before. This consists of directions, and checkpoints that contestants need to pass through.

One of [[wiki:notable_individuals#Broham Lincoln]]'s friends here finds him the night before.

//"Hey, you get a roadbook yet?"//

//"Nope. Don't feel like standing in line."//

//"Well, I'll save you the trouble. You can have mine"//

//"Come again?"//

//"I'm not going, and neither should you."//, he say's as he tosses the map to Broham.

This years roadbook is nearly suicidal, with checkpoints near [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Korth | Korth]] and an entire section traversing **The Labyrinth** in [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Demon_Wastes | The Demon Wastes]]
==== (Start) Lake Home ====

A town of beach dwarves in the Mror Holds serves as the starting point, as well as the best place to party before the race. It's Fantasy Miami.

==== Korunda Gate ====

A city focused entirely on security gets bored, so it's agreed to allow the first checkpoint to be the literal [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Korunda_Gate | Korunda Gate]]. There are no major difficulties when crossing the **IronRoot Mountains** to get here.

==== Icetop Mountains ====

A simple task, but not necessarily easy. The air is cold and thin up here. Here's to hoping you have some sort of breathing apparatus or magic.

==== Atur ====

Might be a good place to have people resupply you on the move if you don't have the magical survivability.

==== The Nightwood ====

A forest with close ties to the Plane of Mabar, it is host to a number of horrible monsters. Most decide to go around. Broham thinks going through it is a better idea. It sure would save time.

If the party is cool with this, and they end up going through The Nightwood, they could run into basically any monster.

==== Korth ====

If you're looking for a fun scripted event, then [[wiki:notable_individuals#Broham Lincoln]] is flying during the exit from the **Northern Wood**, and is unable to cope with the large number of surface to air defenses. He is knocked out, and the party crashes.

Karranth military police are advancing on the crash site to arrest the interlopers, and the party will need to defend itself.

I personally sent a **Bone Knight** and **4 Karrnathi Undead Soldiers** at the party, but gave them some cool abilities.

  * The **Bone Knight** had the ability to call for **fire support**, producing increasingly accurate fireballs each turn.
    * //FB-2, this is MP-5, fire mission, over//
    * //Grid PG 934 498, over//
    * //Armed Baka-R participants in cover. Danger Close, over.//
    * (//Adjust Fire. Direction 1700, add x, left y, over.//
  * the **Karrnathi Undead Soldiers** had
    * the ability to fire on any moving creature as a reaction
    * As well as reduce the movement speed and effectiveness of anyone they were shooting at.

After a short time, someone else lands next to them, giving them the **Coopertition** speech, and helping them repair the ship.

==== Thronehold, Flamekeep, The Face of Tira, Fairhaven, Passage ====

All places with lots of spectators and not much danger. Thronehold is where most are actually resupplying. If the ship sustained damage, it's a good idea to phone ahead and get spare parts.

==== Arcanix ====

This is where [[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh Teller]] ended up in his search for the appropriate knowledge and materials. If the party has ignored him up until now, he is in the middle of heisting both.

==== The Demon Wastes ====

There are four checkpoints in [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Demon_Wastes | The Demon Wastes]]:

  - The Ash Beacon
  - North-East entrance to **The Labyrinth**
  - South-West exit of **The Labyrinth**
  - The Lake of Fire.

The party may have to rescue some people who got taken down by a Rakshasa and its minions. Remember **Coopertition**.

Alternatively, The demons could force the party to play "Trial by Trolley." with your favorite characters added into the mix.
==== The Great Crag ====

Once the party has left **The Demon Wastes**, they're on the home stretch. The only checkpoint left before Sharn is **The Great Crag** in [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Droaam | Droaam]].

These are just some cool rock climbing monsters who watch the race after really sending it. No danger unless you want it to be there.

===== Sharn =====

This is the final stage of the race, and involves several checkpoints. The danger here is the other contestants. Since this is so close to the finish line, **coopertition** goes out the window. Everyone wants the checkered flag.
