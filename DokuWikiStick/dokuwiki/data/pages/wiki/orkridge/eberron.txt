====== Eberron ======

The Eberron portion of the campaign makes few changes to the published material save for the planet's origin story.

===== A History =====

Eberron was the Home World of an empire that spanned dozens of planets. Due to it's political and historical position, and the lethargy of it's people, the technological level of the planet has actually regressed over time. It did not have the specialists necessary to actually sustain itself without its colonies.

==== Civil War ====

The Warforged 101st scouting platoon is investigating rumors of a new superweapon being developed by one of the civilizations that the empire is currently conquering. The local scientists activate the device rather than let it fall into the hands of the enemy. This is the event described in [[wiki:orkridge:The Lost Peaks#100 Years Ago | The Lost Peaks, 100 Years Ago]].

Empire scientists rapidly reverse engineer the device, and use it to pacify the local populace.

Greed, mixed with the opportunity that such technology presents, starts a civil war. Entire fleets are annihilated. Each faction has a foothold on Eberron, and Khorvaire gets the worst of it.

On every world, scientific specialists are abducted, bought, assassinated, left for dead. After 50 years of war, most worlds no longer have the technological capabilities for interplanetary travel. Considering Eberron's already technologically disadvantaged position, even mastery over many conventional technologies is lost. This leads to the canonical level of technology in "Eberron: Rising From the Last War."

By the end of the war, Cyre is considered by many nations to be the most dangerous, simply because they've retained most of their technology. They still control an orbital blockade system, and the other nations are quite unhappy about that.

The last stockpiles of this new device are used in an enormous battle in Cyre. This leads to the Mourning, and the canonical magical and political effects of it described in the aforementioned sourcebook.

==== Notable Locations ====

[[wiki:orkridge:Sharn]]
is the obvious cool spot. This city has a remarkable penchant for extreme sports, including a very popular and technically illegal street race, aerial jousting, and wingsuit flying.

[[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]]
When New Elfington gets transported into the Mourning, it becomes the subject of incredible intrigue. Cyrian refugees view it as a promised land, a city within their nation to which they can emigrate to, but the residents just want to get their city back to Faerun.

[[wiki:orkridge:Metrol]]
The Mourning struck Metrol hard, and many of the residents took refuge in it's extensive metro system. A civilization of sorts lives in that metro now, a la Metro 2033. They can only get onto the surface for short periods of time, so they don't know that Cyre was the only nation affected by the Mourning.

Furthermore, it is rumored to be the location of a secret base that controls the orbital blockade system.

==== Notable Individuals ====

===== Activities in Eberron=====

[[wiki:orkridge:eberron#Cool Spots|Sharn]] has a little bit of anything for anyone, and is meant to be the "home base" for the players. Any activity that the player characters want to partake in can probably be found in one of its districts. If it can't be found, you can at least take a train to an easily accessible city that does.

==== Shopping! ====

Sentimental about some weapons? Get them upgraded at **Alfyn Pennysworth**'s Artificing.
Want to get up to date on tech? There's some [[wiki:orkridge:items|cool new gear]] out there!
==== Research ====

One thing that mages might want to do is research the magic that caused New Elfington to teleport here, (or of course anything else). Morgrave University has an incredibly stocked library, though it's focus has less to do with arcana and more with distant lands, planets, and history. Most books have been scavenged from fires during the war, and both authors and experts are often dead. Players are unlikely to find direct answers to their questions about particularly powerful magic there.

For this purpose, they likely need to travel to [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_University_of_Wynarn |The University of Wynarn]] or [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanix | Arcanix]]

Some very hard research, and perhaps friend making, reveals to the players that the spell "Teleportation Circle" is limited to travel within one plane... normally. one can upcast it at level 6 to teleport physical objects, level 7 to travel between planes, and level 8 to travel anywhere.

Players might also finally figure out the internal workings of The Device. They might learn that focusing more than one teleportation circle on a material with magical resonance abilities can enhance the range of the spell.

==== The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)====

Sharn is known in particular for it's penchant for extreme sports. One that's coming up in particular is the [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Race_of_Eight_Winds| Race of Eight Winds]], modified from the canonical form to be far more inclusive to participants, and much more gruelling. It is known colloquially as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar|Baka Race]] since only idiots would participate. It's also not strictly legal, though no law enforcement agency dares, or even wants to, interfere.

Anyone and Everyone can join. This aerial race runs through the entire continent of Eberron, starting in the Mror Holds, and ending in the Highest Towers of Sharn.

=== Rules ===

Individual contestants join one of eight teams, and pay what they want into a pot, with a minimum entry fee of 200 GP. The first individual to cross the finish line wins the pot for their team, and a little something for themselves. This, and the fact that the race takes an entire week, encourages teamwork.

"You've ne'er done one of these before have you? If word gets out that I didn't stop to help you, no one's gonna stop to help me when I have trouble. A whole  week of this... It's guaranteed to happen. No, the big booms only start when you get close to the finish line. That's why they have the final stretch go through Sharn."

The "Little Something" for first place is a blank scroll of 8th level. This is a scroll that replicates the ability of the 9th level spell "Wish" to replicate the effects of any 8th level spell.
