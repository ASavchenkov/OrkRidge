====== Orbital Blockade ======

Orbiting around Eberron at  8 kilometers per second, dozens of autonomous weapons platforms search the sky below and above for anyone who may deign to leave or enter the planet. Since it was put up, no one has been able to get through.

This concept is also borrowed from Altered Carbon, specifically the state of Harlan's world, but with a less alien root.

===== History =====

Cyre had used the blockade to keep allies from other planets from sending aid to their enemies, but all it did was make more enemies for them. When the Mourning happened, the autonomous orbital blockade was still operational.

Rumor has it the command bunker that can shut it down is still somewhere in [[wiki:orkridge:eberron#Metrol]], but no expedition into the Mourning has ever made it back to report.


===== Metrol Metro =====

A number of factions oddly similar to the very ones that currently occupy Khorvaire occupy the different stations.
