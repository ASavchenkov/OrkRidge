====== Campaign Notes ======

During the night, **The Goose** wanted to go out to pee, but smelled beef jerky. He followed the scent to the nearest hospital, where he wreaked havoc, and got super high on **Dreamily jerky**.

Zanriel got some "services" from a mob water elemental.
===== Character Goals =====

==== Zanriel ====

=== Boromar Clan ===
Working with the Boromar Clan to build smuggling trade routes to New Elfington (since Thrane is setting up a quarantine.)

That being said, they're not happy with his performance at the United Kingdoms, so his room key at the luxury hotel is invalidated, with a note left for him. "Everybody gets one."

=== Hexblade ===

Hexblade asks Zanriel to steal the hot rock for him.

Hexblade is tired of Shadowfell, and it's not alone. It and his comrades want light.

After [[wiki:orkridge:Chapter 1#The Device | a random mountain]] teleports to Shadowfell, it realizes that whatever magic caused this could be used to teleport his entire city into the Feywild.

It is in the interest of this goal that it employs a number of Warlocks to collect items and information of relevance to this teleportation magic. When one of his warlocks is teleported during the events of [[wiki:orkridge:chapter_5| The Financial Crash]], it realizes that whatever material [[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh]] used could speed his efforts.

It needs the lichium used in Eberronian Sky Coaches. Once it collects enough, it creates the device, and teleports the entire cliff city of Edgeton to... Eberron, right at the end of the [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)]]. That's right, directing the device is //hard//.


==== Char Marks ====

Talking with [[wiki:notable_individuals#Magi Suko]] about getting medical supplies to New Elfington (potentially via a Boromar Smuggling route).

Also interested in getting more involved in science.

Also looking to build up an industry either here or in Faerun.

Travel to Aundair to further hash scientific details falls under the side/main quest [[wiki:orkridge:Lichium]]
==== P4-A1 ====

Looking to take down the orbital blockade net by finding members of the previous government.

The war has only just ended, and most effort has been on rebuilding, not getting back into space, but it is rumored that the control bunker is still dormant somewhere in [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#Metrol]].
==== Wedge ====

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Laurens ir'Tain]] mentions to Wedge when they're leaving.

"Oh. You there. I've been looking for an outsiders touch on something. Come by the ir'Tain manor if you're up for some well paying work."

He is hiring Wedge to resolve the [[wiki:orkridge:Altered Cats]]

More-phine?

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Iyanna ir'Talan]] notices him at the pharmacy picking up the (legal and recreational) morphine. "Yo just cause it's legal doesn't mean you should be doing it."

She thinks that morphine was made legal just because the large corps already had large production facilities for it, and the city decided to just tax it since it needs the money. She's unhappy with her father's complacency with the situation too.

==== Roveliss ====

Roveliss is aiming to create an underground zen network of bards. Unfortunately Eberron already has a network of bards, in the form of a corporate propaganda machine called **The Circle of Song**. Corrupted by the economic influence of the Dragonmarked houses, this organization primarily creates "sponsored content", and is always happy to have someone new to exploit.

Not everyone in this organization has given up though, and given some pushing, bards around Eberron might attempt to reclaim their artistic integrity.
===== Session 3 plans =====

It rains that night. When they wake up, they see a rainbow. For everyone except for Paul, this is the first time they've ever seen a rainbow, and it kinda hurts to look at. Paul realizes that he's never seen a rainbow on Faerun.

===== Session 4 Plans =====

  * **Hot as Helm**
  * trying to make peace with Rei d'Thuranni (who absolutely will start making good on her threats):
    * poisoning The Goose.
    * Attack on LegOlas.
    * Attack on Kallan Starfield.
    * Keeping them from visiting any corporate establishments. (Only food available will be in the lower layers of the city.)
  * Next day involves another hearing in the morning.
    * Representatives mention that their nations have been informed about the true nature of "The Device", and all bets are off wrt. not doing research on it.
    * Prince Oargev says his people are already starting to emigrate to New Elfington, and he can't even do anything about it.
    * **Cousin Bob**
    * **John Buskinman**

===== Session 5 Plans =====

  * **Magi Suko** heads back up to Arcanix to organize her researchers and equipment.
  * Remind players that the world moves even when they don't.
    * [[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh]] gets to Arcanix.
    * Through a display of magical power, he ingratiates himself with her lab.
    * He's trying to figure out who here might know more about "The Device".
    * The Lord of Blades is contacted by [[wiki:notable_individuals#Danielle Droman]]
      * He is instructed to attack only Thranish ships during the attack, and to make it seem like the Boromar Clan paid for this to happen.

  * On the train ride the tracks are covered by a landslide while they're near a small town.
  * They can stop and get some lunch, maybe some wine?
  * Also [[wiki:orkridge:Donald Quixote]]
  * **Reda Aenward** is the air elemental

===== Session 6 Plans =====

  * If the party manages to kill the mimic from [[wiki:orkridge:Donald Quixote]]'s story, the town and media immediately start to converge around it.
  * It's the largest mimic in the world, and someone will almost certainly pay good money for it.
  * That being said, mimics are an endangered species here, so...

===== Session 7 Plans =====

  * Timothee Chalamet's parents are headed to **Passage** upon hearing that this mimic is on sale. His dad wants it donated to a museum.
  * A police officer replaces the professional auctioneer, searching for someone who is apparently purchasing an illicit item. He does a very bad job of auctioning while searching for their bad guy.
  * This bad guy is looking to buy a vintage Lichium Dragonshard.

===== Session 8 Plans =====

  * Fight the beholder.
  * While fighting the beholder, Hexblade starts talking to Zanriel
    * Saying that his boss who he rarely talks to wants to talk to him specifically, and to meditate when he's done with the fight.
    * Hexblades boss is [[wiki:notable_individuals#Danielle Droman]], who uses Hexblade to search out appropriate fighters to get into the real world in the future.
