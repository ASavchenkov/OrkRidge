[[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] was teleported to [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron]], specifically into the heart of the Mournland, next to [[wiki:orkridge:Kalazart]]. The good news is that much like [[wiki:orkridge:the Lost Peaks]], the ground level of New Elfington is higher than the ground level of where it was teleported to, about 1 KM above, meaning the inhabitants of the city are safe from the Gray Mist.

Far away, at [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Arythawn_Keep | Arythawn Keep]], Thranian scout officer [[wiki:orkridge:Ogma Fronis]] is called to the watchtower.

"What the fuck.... Tira Miron above..."

"Sound the alarm. Send animal messengers to Vathirond and Aruldsk. Tell Vathirond to fortify for an unknown threat, and to send for help. The Mournland is... moving."

An eagle makes it to Aruldsk, an owl to Vathirond. In Vathirond, a Brelish spy overhears the talk of the town, and barely makes it on the train headed to Starilaskur. When she gets there, she immediately passes the information on to an elven mage that casts sending to a military official in Sharn.

====== New Elfington ======

It is only to the West that anyone can see land not covered in this Gray Mist, and even then it is so far on the horizon that one might think it to be a hallucination.

The contingent of Oosah military that happened to be in New Elfington, led by Dron at the time rapidly institutes martial law. Citizens are obviously terrified of what happened. Leosh Teller escapes and his crew is jailed for terrorism, and Dron enlists the party in taking on dangerous tasks.


===== Effects of Eberron on Faerunians =====

Eberron is a more advanced simulation. It has slightly different physics, graphical processing, kinematics. These minute differences in the linkage between the mind of an individual and the world around it cause problems for the mind. Some can adapt, as the Warforged did, while others suffer increasingly horrible mental damage over the months to come.

The very first pieces of this information should be hinted at while they're still in new Elfington, but the first real alarm should be raised when they're already in Sharn.

  - First some minor difficulty focusing.
  - A minor headache.
  - Nausea.
  - Splitting migranes
  - Loss of coordination.
  - Various madnesses.
===== Children on the Edge =====

At some point the party likely gets to the edge of the plateau. They notice some children pretty close to the edge.

A DC 15 Survival check reveals that this section of cliff is unstable, and going to fall over at any moment.
A DC 15 Perception check reveals to the players that some cracking noise is happening underneath. This gives them even less time to save the kids though.

===== Vagrants and Activists =====


The first is to deal with some rioters that have taken over food stores and taken hostages. He's reluctant to send the military in. The gang believes that the government will not ration food fairly.

===== Explore the Mist =====

Dron wants to know everything he possibly can about the mist below. Is it dangerous? How deep does it go? What's underneath it? He tasks the party with discovering all of this.

==== Effects of the Mist on Players ====
Every 10 minutes spent in the mist require a constitution saving throw of DC 17 against this poisonous mist. On a failure, the character takes 2d6 poison damage, and rolls on the "Short Term Madness" table.

On the third failure, players roll on the long term madness table instead.

Features or items that interact with inhaled poison work normally. (Such as dwarven poison resistance.)

==== Steam Powered Giraffe ====

When the party reaches the ground and begins exploring, the first thing they notice is the silhouette of a giraffe. A perception check reveals more about the situation.

  * DC 15: The giraffe seems to be exhaling some steam.
  * DC 19, or very close observation: The giraffe seems to consist of both meat and metal, combined in unholy matrimony.
  * DC 23: A giant Displacer Beast is crouched in the brush, ready to pounce on the giraffe.
  * DC 25: This displacer beast is also covered in metal much like the giraffe.

The party also makes a group stealth roll.

  * DC 25: Neither animal notices the players.
  * DC 22: The Displacer Beast takes note of them and circles around to ambush them instead.
  * DC 18: The giraffe also notices them, turns, and strikes a defensive pose.

The Giraffe has an AC of 17, while the Displacer Beast's AC has been increased to 18. These high AC's are a result of this new meatal armor that they seem to both have. The displacer beast has double the hit dice and it's size goes up by 1.

==== The Town of Kalazart====

A road ends in the cliff face, and extends westwards. This road leads through a ringed city. Entering the city along this road takes them through:
  - Lower income housing.
  - Wealthy housing,
  - Warehouses and manufacturing.
  - The central market.

Potential soundtrack during narration: **Snarky Puppy; Even Us**.

By pure coincidence, a group of warforged operating under the command of the [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_Blades| Lord of Blades]] returns from a scouting expedition to determine what's going on with this new geological phenomenon that just appeared out of nowhere.

If the party manages to stay hidden, they can observe the warforged as they enter a warehouse/factory. They are reporting back to the **Lord of Blades** along what seems to be a landline going South. Their message is to mobilize an aerial scout to **Kalazart**
===== First Contact =====

On the second day, an airship is spotted North-East of the city. It seems to be headed right for them. This is a house of the Lyrandar airship sent by the nation of [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Thrane | Thrane]]. Within hours a second airship is spotted behind and to the South of it. This one was sent by [[https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Breland | Breland]]. Both border the Mournland, and both want to claim domain over whatever the hell is happening here. Other nations will follow, but their spies have yet to hear of this development.

The ships arrive nearly at the same time, and the leaders, Nicole Zeph and Keira Cane are both are mostly civil towards each other, but each primarily ignores the other's claim to any authority, which obviously produces some tension. If things come to a boil, both manage to cool themselves off, and report the situation to their superiors. Rather suspiciously, after this happens, they're both suddenly on the same page.

What actually happened is that they both got instructions from their corporate overlord [[wiki:orkridge:Laurens Ir'Tain]] to work together and bring the discussion to Sharn, where economic interests can better exploit the situation.

New Elfington will temporarily be considered sovereign. During that time period, it needs to send envoys to Sharn to discuss this event with officials from each nation.

====== Murder on the Lighting Rail ======
**(Optional)**

The party is taken by airship to the nearest train station, at which point they transfer to a Lightning Rail. During this transfer, the party is swarmed with reporters. One manages to sneak a bug into the armor of the most important looking party member.


This train is not only carrying passengers, but also some precious cargo the identity of which is not revealed to the party. It is a clone for the fabulously wealthy [[wiki:orkridge:laurens_ir_tain| Laurens ir'Tain]]. This clone is a target for an agent of House Thuranni, who wishes to sabotage it to get more leverage over Laurens. See [[wiki:orkridge:Plot Against Laurens]].

The first sign that something is wrong is when this agent falls into a catatonic state as the result of the spell **Magic Jar**. It would be hard to identify this spell however, because the magic jar is not on his person, but in his room.

The agent then possesses the butler, slowly maneuvering him to the back of the carriage so as to take down the necromancy barrier, until he finally releases the butler back into his body, and projects his soul into the body of Lauren[[wiki:orkridge:laurens_ir_tain]].
====== Sharn ======

{{wiki:sharn2.jpg}}

Sharn is... huge, specifically tall. It's a full 2km high at the tip of its grounded towers, and another kilometer up to the top of the floating towers. Beside that, it's also 7 km in diameter.

The party arrives at Terminus station, Sharn, and is immediately escorted to **The Cornerstone** in **Middle Tavick's Landing**., after having been assailed by paparazzi. 

"Your accomodations have been taken care of, a gesture of goodwill from house Ghallanda. The hearings and meetings will begin tomorrow."

===== Heated Debate =====

The party is invited to the highest towers to begin the hearings. Everyone has something they want out of the situation, including New Elfington, hence the entourage they sent.

  * [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] just wants to get the city back home where it was.
  * **New Cyre** believes new Elfington to be the promised land. A city within Cyre, safe from the Gray mist. They actually want to emigrate there and start fighting against the Gray Mist.
  * **Breland** wants to set up businesses there and make a lot of profit off of looting Cyre beneath the Mist.
  * **Thrane**: The Sacred Flame claims this to be the work of evil forces. No one is to be let in or out until they have deemed the situation stable and free of demonic influence.
  * **Aundair** just wants to send its people to New Elfington to do some research.
  * **Everyone** puts 2 and 2 together at some point, and realizes that the "devices" used in the war were not purely destructive. They teleport to potentially livable places. The rush is on to rediscover this technology, and use it for both military and civil purposes.
