====== Chapter 1: Area 52 ======

The characters are off to some dungeon or other. Whwat's inside isn't particularly important. The fact that it resides in technically off limits territory near Neverwinter that the Gerbaut has reserved for highly secret reasons.  The **Lost Mine of Phandelver** would likely be a good option since DMs could transition from that starter adventure to this one rather easily (assuming they haven't built too much high fantasy lore up already).

Levels 5-6

====== The Toxic Jungle ======

On the way to the dungeon, they pass through an odd circular jungle. It's primarily populated by small fauna, **Giant Wolf Spiders** and **Ettercaps**. Though the characters cannot smell anything amiss, the air is mildly poisonous as the result of a failed Gerbaut weapon test.

In the very center is a swampy pond, a nest of **Ettercaps**, and the mangled bottom half of a steel structure reminiscent of a radio tower. Nearby is a destroyed concrete building, along with two dead people, both wearing full hazmat diving gear. If the players use this gear to look at what's at the bottom of the pond, they find shards of steel and lead, the outside of which is inscribed with tiny **Teleportation Circles**

===== Ghillie Mages =====

Two Gerbaut mages hide in ambush. Both have double the maximum range on their spells, and use this range to its maximum. They attack from opposite sides, keeping as much difficult terrain in between them and the party as possible.

====== The Device ======

Working through this dungeon, they find it suspiciously easy, and recently disturbed. They finally find a large spherical device with dozens of the same tiny **Teleportation Circles** on it. They're accosted by **Eddard Teller** and his entourage. The party is a loose end for his secretive weapon design group, and Teller will leave the capture of the party to his crew.



Regardless of result, the players witness the weapon in action far enough away so as to not be within its effective range, and the cave system and mountain above it vanish into thin air, leaving a 2 mile wide crater.

Either in chains, or bloodied and wanted by the Gerbaut military, the party will need to somehow end up in Neverwinter. Circumstance puts them in contact with the Resistance. The party will be asked to perform several acts of subterfuge, including stealing some advanced weaponry (lever action rifles), and destroying some advanced technology (Electrical applicances of war, designed by Esanians for the Gerbaut against their will). Their hideout is discovered sooner or later, and one of the wizards leading the Resistance creates a teleportation circle for them to escape to Oosah and notify them of this new superweapon. The party is the only group to escape cleanly however, and all but two wizards are captured by the Gerbaut.
