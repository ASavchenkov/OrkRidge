======  Character Moves ======

Though it isn't absolutely necessary, we stick with the tried and true PbtA model of having classes that start with some moves by default, choose something extra from their class, and then choose from any classes move-set on level-up.

==== Starting Moves ====

  * **Positioning advantage**
  * You're always ready for things to kick off. At the beginning of combat, Roll INT
    * **Success:**

      * If a fictional obstacle between where you want to be and where you are can reasonably be overcome, you were already prepared to do it.
        * You've been sizing up that gap for a running leap.
        * You found some convenient handholds to climb up to the second floor.
    * **Mixed Success:** Choose one from the below:
      * The spot is good, the route isn't. Roll to **Run for it.**
      * Too good to be true.
        * Maybe the floor is weak
        * or the wall is too low to serve as cover.
        * Maybe there's something in the way of your perfect shot.
      * You dropped whatever you were holding at the moment.
        * It's right where you were when combat started.
        * If the nature of this item wasn't already established in fiction, the GM chooses.
  * **Primary Target:**
    * Choose one enemy per combat.
    * You have +1 on moves pertaining to taking this target down, whether it be movement, weapon moves, or special moves.
    * Final judgement on relevance is up to the GM.

==== Choose one more from the below. ====

  * **Hold Still**:
