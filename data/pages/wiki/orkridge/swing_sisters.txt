====== Swing Sisters ======

Described in medium detail [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington#Swing Sisters| here]], the Swing Sisters are rising stars, and have a show at a nearby casino.

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Dron]] invites them to go see it once they've become acquainted.


====== Smoke On the Water ======

The party arrives to a strange scene. A large portion of the local law enforcement seems to be present. As the show starts, the Swing Sisters of course give a shout out to the "New Elfington law enforcement community".

Partway through the show, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_on_the_Water | "Some stupid with a flare gun"]] sets one of the tapestries on fire, and people start evacuating. the Swing Sisters start running one way, and everyone else is running another way.

If the party runs in the same direction as the Swing Sisters, they'll bump into some [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington#Duads]], who have their own bone to pick with the Swing Sisters, and plan to kidnap them.

All this time, "A [[wiki:notable_individuals#Funky Claude]] was running in and out, pulling kids out the ground."
