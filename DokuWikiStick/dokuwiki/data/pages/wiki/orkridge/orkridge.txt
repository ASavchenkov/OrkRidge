====== Ork Ridge ======

"Ork Ridge" is an adventure focused on the "what if?" of a [[wiki:orkridge:Faerun]] going through an industrial and cultural revolution. Nationalistic governments seek to dominate the world, and talented magical talent is tapped to create horrible weapons. Events closely mirror the real history of the industrial revolution, WW2, and the Cold War. Levels 5-10 follow the players as they discover the creation of such a weapon, and try to stop its further development and use.

Levels 11-15 then take the players, and the entire city they're in, to [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron]], where this city's mayor enlists them in securing the future of his people.

====== Adventure Chronology ======

===== Chapter 1 The Resistance=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_1]]

Levels 4-5

The adventure starts with the players heading to and exploring a cave dungeon. They stumble upon a Gerbaut secret weapon, and are embroiled in an [[#Esania]] resistance movement in Neverwinter, culminating in their hairy escape to The Oosahn city of New Elfington.

===== Chapter 2 New Elfington=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_2]]

Levels 7-8

Unfortunately, teleportation circle capable ships are not yet in position, so the party has some time in [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]], the capital of Oosah. There are numerous attractions in this city, including a reviving swing scene, a demolition derby, a powerful drug cartel, and the mysterious disappearance of the Warforged.

===== Chapter 3 Trek to the North Forest=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_3]]

Level 9

The big day of the liberation has come, and the party is to head behind enemy lines to find the resistance members, and get the location of the lab in which this weapon is built. This requires that they travel East to the [[wiki:orkridge:The Lost Peaks]], where resistance members are likely held in the Ghoulash. This plan likely takes them through war torn Neverwinter, Neverwinter Wood, Triboar, and finally the High Forest, where they find the Goulash and the Resistance.

===== Chapter 4 Ork Ridge=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_4]]

Level 9

Upon rescuing the captured Resistance members, they take refuge in a cave system in [[wiki:orkridge:the_lost_peaks]]. The nature of this strange geological formation is revealed to them, as is the location of Ork Ridge, the laboratory where the weapon was created. They must then deal with Eddard Teller's plans for this weapon.

===== Chapter 4.5 interlogue =====

Level 10

The war isn't over. The Oosah has the upper hand, but the road ahead is a hard one. If the party want's to involve themselves in the rest of the war effort, they'll end up fighting in Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, the final bastions of the Gerbaut military. They will then enjoy some time off.

===== Chapter 5 The Financial Crash=====
[[wiki:orkridge:chapter_5]]

Level 10

Post War Faerun is debt hungry, and after two years of what seems to be growth, the economy collapses. Major governments and institutions hold a conference to resolve the issue, but it is attacked and held hostage by [[wiki:orkridge:Char Marks]]. It is unfortunately necessary for the weapon to trigger, teleporting the entirety of New Elfington to [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron]].
