====== Foreign Relations ======

The delegation has had its fun, but now it needs to get to business.

===== Heated Debate =====

The party is invited to the highest towers to begin the hearings. Everyone has something they want out of the situation, including New Elfington, hence the entourage they sent.

  * [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington]] just wants to get the city back home where it was.
  * **Breland** wants to set up businesses there and make a lot of profit off of looting Cyre beneath the Mist.
    * Conveniently represented by [[wiki:notable_individuals#Laurens ir'Tain]]
    * **The Boromar Clan** wants it to be a free economic zone with no taxes.
      * Represented by **Saidan Boromar.** who has [[wiki:notable_individuals#Ilbert]] as an aide.
      * Their representation is a source of division as they aren't even a nation.
  * **New Cyre** believes new Elfington to be the promised land. A city within Cyre, safe from the Gray mist. They actually want to emigrate there and start fighting against the Gray Mist.
    * Represented by [[wiki:orkridge:eberron#Prince Oargev]] himself.
    * Their representation is used by the Boromar Clan to justify their own representation, as New Cyre is also technically not a nation.
  * **Thrane**: The Sacred Flame claims this to be the work of evil forces. No one is to be let in or out until they have deemed the situation stable and free of demonic influence.
    * Represented by **Rory Steiger.**
  * **Aundair** just wants to send its people to New Elfington to do some research.
    * Represented by **Magi Suko**.
  * **Karrnath** doesn't really care much at all.
    * Represented by **Ealwold Quinte**
  * **Everyone** puts 2 and 2 together at some point, and realizes that the "devices" used in the war were not purely destructive. They teleport to potentially livable places. The rush is on to rediscover this technology, and use it for both military and civil purposes.

Each representative fights vigorously for their cause. Few are thinking about the well-being of New Elfington itself, save for **Rory Steiger**, who believes that the current residents are in grave danger.

[[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#Iyanna ir'Talan]], as their primary contact, is also there, and is visibly perturbed by this embarrassing display of selfishness on the part of her countrymen.

If the nature of New Elfington's appearance is revealed by the party (and it's very likely that it will be because representatives will ask), the tone of the talks changes drastically. Members start to leave with no warning, and in a rush. They're communicating this information to their own nations.

===== Leosh's Plans =====

Leosh has his own plans. He's made it out of New Elfington with his father through a casting of a **Teleport** spell, specifically to **Anythrawn Keep**. From there he makes an arduous journey through Thrane to **Aundair: Arcanix**, where he hopes to learn more about the physics behind this device he made.

This gets him embroiled in the [[wiki:orkridge:COLA]] strikes at **Arcanix**
===== Rainbow =====

After their first session in the **United Kingdoms**, it starts raining. This is important because when it stops raining, there will be a rainbow, which should be entirely foreign to native Faerunians since //there aren't any rainbows on Faerun.//

It hurts to look at, but the pain subsides over time, and it's beautiful.

===== Branching Out =====

It is at this point that the party will probably want to become involved in the city. They have some time to do what they want to do. Certain thematically appropriate "side quests" are linked below.

  * [[wiki:orkridge:Altered CATS]]: A rip off of "Altered Carbon" and "CATS". Classic murder mystery with two twists.
  * [[wiki:orkridge:Baka R]]
  * [[wiki:orkridge:COLA]]
  * [[wiki:orkridge:Lichium]] Try to learn the secrets of "The Device" 
  * [[wiki:orkridge:Orbital Blockade]] Metro 2033 inspired delve into Metrol
  * [[wiki:orkridge:Steamed Hams]] "Steamed Hams"

====== Dreaming Dark ======

We first need to throw out a lot of the canonical **Dreaming Dark** that one might read about in **Eberron: Rising From the Last War**. The beings that show up in mortal dreams are not "spirits", but humans in the world of [[wiki:afpd:afpd|Argument For Poor Design]]. 

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Thin Anthony Hopkins]] has already contacted the party in their dreams before, but he is not alone. Members of his team occasionally went in when intervention was necessary.

Sometimes though, the [[wiki:afpd:mission_n#Doodle's AI work | clients]] would want to inspect the "product" and "guide" the design process. This regularly resulted in chaos and suffering, frequently in the form of warfare, but that is precisely what they wanted. Then, once they finished their inspection, the team building this world would come back to try and bring stability back.

This is the cause of the "cycles" that Eberron's inhabitants believe occur in the "plane of Dal Quor". For long periods of time, these dreams are mostly helpful, then for a short time they wreak havoc, then the cycle repeats.

===== Danielle Droman =====


[[wiki:notable_individuals#Danielle Droman]] recently replaced the previous [[wiki:afpd:corps#Academica]] inspector after the higher ups determined he wasn't doing a good enough job. She works zealously to achieve Academica's goals, stirring up conflict wherever she can.
