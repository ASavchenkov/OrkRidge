====== Mission N+4 ======

The party's plan is as such:

===== 1) Double Sleeve =====

Each member of the party has a body as a backup, but why use it as a backup when you can load yourself into it and have two of yourself?

===== 2) Dirty Bomb =====

The duplicate party members travel to San Diego for **Comic Con**. Their contacts at **People For the Ethical Treatment of AI (PETAI)** know someone who can supply them with a dirty bomb.

On their way there they bump into a Pickle Rick cosplayer and kill him in cold blood, shoving him into the bay to be chopped up by propellers. Nobody bats an eye.

The secret code for buying the dirty bomb is simple. The **Shokugeki no Soma** booth has a hot sauce drinking contest. After winning the contest, a member of the party is to take the challenge of drinking an entire bottle of "Ghost Pepper Sauce" as a display of determination. For the party, this is of no issue since they have poorly calibrated taste buds.

===== 3) Neo Yokio =====

At the midpoint between New York and Tokyo, a recent seismic event produced a rather large island. Somehow, large corporations managed to turn this into their own corporate nation, where most of their activities are legal because they say they are. Sensitive servers, papers, and people, are all hidden away here to keep them away from the prying eyes of the worlds governments.

This is where the party will go to meet [[wiki:afpd:corps#Academica]]'s "top brass"

This is where the duplicate party will detonate their dirty bomb, making the island uninhabitable to humans, a refuge for AI.


===== 4) Trade =====

The offer is simple. Academica provides the servers housing **Eberron** and **Faerun**, and the party will in return provide the private servers of every corporation on the island.
