===== LAPD =====

Half corrupt. There's still good people in it, but they know to keep their heads down. The city doesn't fund them, so they have to fund themselves if you know what I mean. Between [[wiki:afpd:mission_1]] and [[wiki:afpd:mission_2]], they complete the purchase of autonomous drones that are "certified" to deploy force if needed. These drones come from [[#Doodle]].

===== Doodle =====

An enormous Google equivalent. If there's a way to make money with something, Doodle owns a piece of it. Their current "big" venture is a partnership with [[#Pauli Automotive]] to integrate self driving tech into Pauli's electric cars.
