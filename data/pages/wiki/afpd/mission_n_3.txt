====== Mission N+3 ======

**Elon Muskito** believes his ([[wiki:afpd:corps#Noblesse O.]]s) mission to complete the **Skyhook** is under threat. In reality it is not, and [[wiki:notable_individuals#Danielle Droman]] wants to lure the party to her.

Academica has gotten their old enemies out of the simulation and placed them in the cargo holds. In the worst case scenario, they will awake and be immediately ready to fight.

  * Jesse
    * Armed with a flamethrower. Pretty self explanatory
  * James
    * Armed with an electrified Monofilament whip.
  * The Black Viper
    * A ballistic knife.
  * HellenRae
    * twin glocks and her fists.

  * Leosh Teller

  * Rei d'Thuranni
  * Captain Othelstan

====== You Should Have Called ======

In my case, the party's helicopter is being tracked via magnetic GPS tracker, so when they go to pick the containers up, **Danielle** is able to personally board the craft stealthily, entering the co-pilot seat while the cargo is being loaded.

//I don't know what it's like in your world, but around here, it's very disrespectful to say you'll call someone, then rob them twice. Wave off, tell them the craft has entered a **vortex ring state** and need to circle back around.//

//I'm a reasonable individual. My superiors wanted to storm the gates. Instead I came alone to speak with [[wiki:notable_individuals#Thin Anthony Hopkins]]. Recent events seem to indicate that they were right. Now. You and your party have caused significant financial, logistical, and political losses to my employer and our partners. You have until you come back for the cargo to discover a way to appropriately compensate them for the damages you have caused. Your time starts now.//

Before push comes to shove, **Danielle** mentions to whoever she's talking with (probably the pilot of the helicopter):

//Perhaps you don't understand. There's no revivify, no reincarnation, no resurrection here for me. I've done dozens of ops more dangerous than this one and come out of them alive and undamaged.//

//Unlike you I have not had crutches to lean on. My team and I have become very good at avoiding death because if I hadn't, I'd be dead.//

====== Campaign Notes ======

My party took her offer, but demanded to speak in person to the "top brass" before going on any missions. **Danielle** obliged, as this was a marked improvement on their previous reckless behavior.

Of course the party is scheming...
