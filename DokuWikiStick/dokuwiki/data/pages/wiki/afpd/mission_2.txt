====== Lo-Fi Hip Hop ======
The group is watching the press conference where Doodle is selling some profiling tech to the [[wiki:afpd:corps#LAPD]] when a lunatic runs up to the stage and stabs the presenter to death. Security needs to shoot the assailant dead in the process.

**Sam Pennyworth** (really [[wiki:notable_individuals#Danielle Droman]]) gives the party a job. This isn't the first such unexplained attack. The higher ups at [[wiki:afpd:corps#Doodle]] aren't convinced that this is just a normal lunatic, but don't want to make waves.

Either convince her that there's no foul play, or find who did it.

===== The Truth =====

However the party arrives at the truth, it is as such:

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Susan Barnes]] has used what she's learned working on **Faerun and Eberron** to develop a sort of **Suggestion** through music. In the right conditions, someone listening to these beats would find a particular type of person distasteful, and would feel anger and fury towards them. In many cases this would just be weird for the person, but some go further than others.

She specifically targeted [[wiki:afpd:corps#Doodle]] C-Levels focused on developing AI tech for the [[wiki:afpd:corps#LAPD]] and [[wiki:afpd:corps#Academica]]. This kept these two entities dependent on the success of **Faerun and Eberron**, and kept them from being too aggressive in negotiations.



====== Notes ======

Jimbo, the Lieutenant Detective in charge, thinks this is a waste of time.

"Lost tapes from Los Angeles" gives them the location to the underground Lo-fi Hip Hop club.

The party wasn't very discrete, and the **LAPD** followed them to one of these clubs, raiding it and killing quite a few.

The party barely escaped through the dark maze that is future LA's abandoned sewage system.
