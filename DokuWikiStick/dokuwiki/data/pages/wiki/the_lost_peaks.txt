The colloquial naming of this landmark is purposefully ironic. It is a single plateau, and it wasn't lost, it was found approximately 100 years ago.

====== Timeline ======

===== 110 years ago. =====

Wood Elves live here, and Orks are invading due to a purposeful misunderstanding of borders on the orks end. Most villages are destroyed. Survivors fight back using guerrilla warfare tactics for 10 years, just barely surviving, but keeping the orks from being too comfortable either.

===== 100 years ago. =====

On [[wiki:Eberron|Eberron]], or rather one of the many planets conquered by it, The [[wiki:Warforged|Warforged]] 7th scouting platoon is attempting to retrieve high value WMD tech. The enemy decides to trigger the device rather than letting it fall into the wrong hands. The town this occurs in disappears immediately, and reappears in the North Forest, where maps erroneously show the "Lost Peaks" now. After the teleportation, the landmass falls several hundred meters, killing all living beings, and destroying many of the Warforged.

Just like that, a 2 mile diameter portion of forest is covered in land, replaced by an enormous plateau. The elves, magical in their nature, kill two birds with one stone. They investigate the plateau as a potential means of strategic advantage, and find the Warforged there. Relations are tense, but the two factions agree on an alliance for the purpose of mutual safety.

Most of the orks leave the High Forest, but enough stay to be dangerous. The Elves and Warforged make a home there. The Warforged teach what they can to the Elves about the technology of their world, and everyone agrees that it should never fall into the wrong hands.

===== 90 years ago. =====

An elderly half-elf necromancer by the name of [[wiki:Claude Dobbs|Claude Dobbs]] arrives to explore this phenomenon. He's apprehended by the Elves and Warforged while rifling through the library. There are no necromantic texts for him to read, but he is interested in the Warforged and their difficulty with resurrection. He begins his research.

===== 70 years ago. =====

Claude feels that the end of his life will come before he can find a solution, and he's become quite fond of the Warforged. The Elves reluctantly agree to help him become a Balenorn. Despite him being half elf, the procedure succeeds.

===== 50 years ago. =====

Claude figures out the problem. "Raise Dead" requires that all organs and limbs necessary for life be attached. It turns out that this definition is more pedantic than they thought. After assembling the destroyed Warforged more precisely, Claude is successful in returning life to them.

===== 40 years ago. =====

The Warforged are back to full force. They decide that they need to do some exploring. The Elves agree to hold down the fort, since it's their home. The Warforged travel East, towards Thay.
