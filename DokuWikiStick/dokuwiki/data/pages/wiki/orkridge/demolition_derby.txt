====== Demolition Derby ======

Not far from New Elfington, there resides an enormous arena for vehicular combat. The party may not only want to watch, but might even want to participate.

This happens to be the base of operations for the [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington#Warforged]]. Any warforged in the party are assumed to be a part of the team, and spirited away towards the garages by officials, even if they originally didn't plan on participating.

If the party does plan on participating, officials are quick to suggest they join the Warforged team, as the current leader has been looking for new recruits.

====== The Warforged Situation ======

With Claude missing, the Warforged have no easy way of bringing their comrades back to life. They don't know that [[wiki:notable_individuals#Funky Claude]] is actually still out there with amnesia, setting gigs up for the [[wiki:orkridge:New Elfington#Swing Sisters]]. If the party can reunite them, and get his memory back, the Warforged will be very thankful.

In the meantime, they need a team //right now//. Will the party join the last surviving member?

====== Da Rules ======

There is only one rule. When the teams conveyance stops moving for a full minute, they're out. Violence is assumed.

====== Contestants ======
----
===== Aquatic Arcana =====

A manta ray shaped hovercraft captained by a mage (potentially **Jim Darkmagic** if you have **Acquisitions Inc.**). Primarily focused on permanently killing or maiming Warforged under instruction from the [[wiki:orkridge:new_elfington#Duads]].

This mage primarily uses minions and summons:

  * [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/3u3n6y/homebrew_undead_sharkenbear/ | Undead Sharkenbear]]
  * **Tunacorn**: A number of illustrations exist on the internet. Use regular unicorn stats and give it a swim speed.
  * **Sharknado**: Once again, many illustrations and stat blocks exist online.

===== Dino Assassin Gang =====

The same participants that raced in [[wiki:orkridge:ne_street_race]] run their **T-Rex** in the derby.

===== The Gravy Train =====

Not an official participant. No one is sure how it got there. This odd locomotive seems to run entirely on gravy. It is manned by a group of goblins and a single angry humanoid. There is only one car behind the locomotive and it is a kitchen. The humanoid is the only one who seems to be unaware of the violent nature of his surroundings and is berating his goblins on the low quality of their cooking. As it gets near the player vehicle, he starts to insult the main characters to do psychic damage, since they're also obviously terrible cooks.


===== Robo Rumble =====

This is the team of warforged.
