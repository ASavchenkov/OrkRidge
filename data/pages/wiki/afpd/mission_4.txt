====== State of the Union ======

  * Bablo Bigasso is dead, and the media has accepted that he was the Pepsi killer.
  * An LAPD investigator is suspicious of the circumstances under which he died, and is investigating.
    *Notable is the fact that Bablo was shot twice
    *That the Fantasy Coke and money were left there, and that he had way too little money for the amount of coke.
    *That Bablo had no prior connections to the drug trade.
  *The LAPD drone thing has gone real bad by now.
