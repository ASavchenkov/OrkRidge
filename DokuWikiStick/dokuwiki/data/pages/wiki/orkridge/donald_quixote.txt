====== Donald Quixote ======

If the players ever spend time in a small town, they'll come across **Donald Quixote**, a paladin on a steed, who tells them:

//"Go no further! See the beasts ahead? Enormous monstrosities menace you with their blades!"//
He is pointing at a windmill.

//"I will dispense with it and then you may pass."//

He then charges with his lance at the windmill, and predictably sticks into it, not affecting it at all.

====== Windmill Mimic ======

That's right. The windmill really is a monster. It's a Gargantuan Mimic.
