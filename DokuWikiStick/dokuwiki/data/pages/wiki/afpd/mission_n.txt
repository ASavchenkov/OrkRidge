====== Mission N ======
[[wiki:afpd:Mission N Notes]]

This is the point at which the [[wiki:orkridge:orkridge | Ork Ridge]] and [[wiki:afpd:AFPD]] plots converge.

===== Doodle's AI work =====

[[wiki:afpd:corps#Doodle]] was approached independently by several entities to produce AI with various capabilites.

  * [[wiki:afpd:corps#Academica]]: is looking for more effective autonomous weapons.
    * Strike Drones that don't need human control.
    * Missiles that can't be defeated by beaming, notching, and the F-Pole Maneuver.
    * Land Drones that can operate in poor conditions with poor communications.
  * [[wiki:afpd:corps#LAPD]]: Wants drones that can enforce the law in lower income neighborhoods.
  * [[wiki:afpd:corps#Solarion]]: Wants drones to do work in hazardous conditions.
  * [[wiki:afpd:corps#Doodle]]: Wants self driving car AI.

Each of these corps wants a basically sentient robot, but is not planning on treating them well. They see a new source of slaves, and have offered the Doodle AI division "A deal they couldn't refuse."

===== Faerun and Eberron as Simulations =====

"Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool: The mistake." - Dr. Ford; Westworld.
"Thin Anthony Hopkins" has decided that the best way to create an AI is to simulate a universe and let it develop on its own. This requires an enormous data-center, each individual stored and run on a special ASIC, but the combination of numerous enormous contracts makes it possible.

==== Faerun ====

Faerun was their first world, primitive, but effective to such a point that individuals learned to the point of creating a basic civilization. When attempting to transfer individuals out of that world and into a robotic body, they found that the "brain" (so to speak) "melted." The difference between the simulated world, and the world the individual could see through their sensor was so great that they suffered from mode collapse trying to adapt too rapidly.

==== Eberron ====

Eberron was "Version 2." It was a much higher fidelity simulation. They learned from their mistakes and created a special race (Warforged) with sensory inputs just like those in their robot prototype chassis. The better simulation helped, but it still wasn't enough.

==== The Purpose of Teleportation ====


OK but what about travelling between simulations, how does that affect the individual?
Eberronians had no issue travelling to Faerun, but the first instance of Faerunians coming to Eberron happens in [[wiki:orkridge:chapter_5|wiki:orkridge:Chapter 5]] of the Ork Ridge Adventure. It... Doesn't go well, but oddly enough a group of adventurers seem to not be particularly affected.


==== A Final Hail Mary ====

Thin Anthony Hopkins did note that the effects were lessened for adventurers, so perhaps life experience makes transition easier? He eggs the party into seeing the world, then finally requests that they try one final world.

This also comes with pressure from Doodle to finish the project so they can hand the results over to [[wiki:afpd:corps#Academica]] and company.

===== The Mission =====

With the delays Hopkins has introduced to try and get some adventurers out, Doodle has agreed to let Academica take the facility with force if necessary, and Hopkins is aware of this, to the point of knowing the exact time of the raid, thanks to the work of

Those that agree to come out are brought to the datacenter/office hybrid from [[wiki:afpd:Mission 1]]. Their bodies are robotic humanoid chassis, of great similarity to their Faerunian bodies. let them Hopkins and his employees have 20 minutes to explain as much as they can before they need to evacuate the party, after all, Academica doesn't know that they were planning to do this.

The rest of the development team arms themselves and prepares to defend the compound from Academica. Members of the party can choose to join them in the defense, but they are told that it is only for appearances, and they will certainly perish.

==== Chill Beats Safehouse ====

The party needs to evacuate to the sewers under LA, where the "Chill Lo-fi Hiphop Beats" producer hides them.
