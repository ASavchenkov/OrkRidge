====== A Brief Overview ======

The Eberron portion of the campaign makes few changes to the published material save for the planet's origin story.

===== A History =====

Eberron was the Home World of an empire that spanned dozens of planets. Due to it's political and historical position, and the lethargy of it's people, the technological level of the planet has actually regressed over time. It did not have the specialists necessary to actually sustain itself without its colonies.

==== Civil War ====

The Warforged 101st scouting platoon is investigating rumors of a new superweapon being developed by one of the civilizations that the empire is currently conquering. The local scientists activate the device rather than let it fall into the hands of the enemy. This is the event described in [[wiki:orkridge:The Lost Peaks#100 Years Ago | The Lost Peaks, 100 Years Ago]].

Empire scientists rapidly reverse engineer the device, and use it to pacify the local populace.

Greed, mixed with the opportunity that such technology presents, starts a civil war. Entire fleets are annihilated. Each faction has a foothold on Eberron, and Khorvaire gets the worst of it.

On every world, scientific specialists are abducted, bought, assassinated, left for dead. After 50 years of war, most worlds no longer have the technological capabilities for interplanetary travel. Considering Eberron's already technologically disadvantaged position, even mastery over many conventional technologies is lost. This leads to the canonical level of technology in "Eberron: Rising From the Last War."

The last stockpiles of this new device are used in an enormous battle in Cyre. This leads to the Mourning, and the canonical magical and political effects of it described in the aforementioned sourcebook.
