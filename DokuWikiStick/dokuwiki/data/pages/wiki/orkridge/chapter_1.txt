====== Chapter 1: Area 52 ======

The characters are off to some dungeon or other. Whwat's inside isn't particularly important. The fact that it resides in technically off limits territory near Neverwinter that the Gerbaut has reserved for highly secret reasons.  The **Lost Mine of Phandelver** would likely be a good option since DMs could transition from that starter adventure to this one rather easily (assuming they haven't built too much high fantasy lore up already).

Levels 5-6

====== The Toxic Jungle ======

On the way to the dungeon, they pass through an odd circular jungle. It's primarily populated by small fauna, **Giant Wolf Spiders** and **Ettercaps**. Though the characters cannot smell anything amiss, the air is mildly poisonous as the result of a failed Gerbaut weapon test.

In the very center is a swampy pond, a nest of **Ettercaps**, and the mangled bottom half of a steel structure reminiscent of a radio tower. Nearby is a destroyed concrete building, along with two dead people, both wearing full hazmat diving gear. If the players use this gear to look at what's at the bottom of the pond, they find shards of steel and lead, the outside of which is inscribed with tiny **Teleportation Circles**

===== Ghillie Mages =====

Two Gerbaut mages hide in ambush. Both have double the maximum range on their spells, and use this range to its maximum. They attack from opposite sides, keeping as much difficult terrain in between them and the party as possible.

====== The Device ======

Working through this dungeon, they find it suspiciously easy, and recently disturbed. They finally find a large spherical device with dozens of the same tiny **Teleportation Circles** on it. They're accosted by [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Eddard Teller]] and his entourage. The party is a loose end for his secretive weapon design group.

===== Encounter NPCs =====

  * [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Eddard Teller]] (VGTM: Evoker):
    * immediately casts **Summon Greater Demon** to summon a demon of DMs choice. One perfect source of the blood for this spell is that of the **Ghillie Mages** if they died.
  * [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Kallan Starfield]] (VGTM : Abjurer):
    * Protects Eddard Teller at all costs.
  * 4 heavily armored guards with pikes instead of morningstars (PotA : Black Earth Guard).
  * Two mage officers(VGM : Illusionist).

After summoning the demon, Eddard and Kallen head to the nearly finished teleportation circle. They trust their employees to subdue the interlopers.

Regardless of result, the players witness the weapon in action far enough away so as to not be within its effective range, and the cave system and mountain above it vanish into thin air, leaving a 2 mile wide crater.

====== Getting to Neverwinter ======
===== Option 1: Party Loses =====

The Gerbaut fight to subdue and capture. Succeeding, they cuff the party and take them to a Neverwinter jail for questioning and a clandestine execution.

In the jail, there are just two other occupants, [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Delphine]] and [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Emil]]. After a short (and if they don't want guards on them, quiet) conversation, an air raid siren goes off.

//That's our cue// says Delphine, to the nodding approval of Emil. They stand and seem to prepare themselves to fight. Then a blast of dragonfire cuts the building in half, narrowly missing the party. Delphine and Emil invite the party to escape with them as guards are focused on the airborne attack on the city.

===== Option 2: Party Wins =====

A timer is going down on **The Device**. The party has plenty of time to get out, but they still need to //do it//.

It is at this point that they do need to end up in Neverwinter. The best course of action is to see what the players want to do. If they want to figure out what's going on, one of the guards will have orders to bring them to the clandestine jail in Neverwinter.

If the conversation does not naturally go in the direction of visiting Neverwinter, simply ask honestly for the players to come up with a good reason to go there, or come up with a quest hook yourself if you're feeling bold.

In Neverwinter, when they pass by an innocuous enough looking building (the jail from Option 1), they hear air raid sirens, and they see a [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Dron|young bronze dragon]], as well as several smaller figures raining fire on oddly precise locations in the city. The dragon cuts the building in half, and from it scurry [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Delphine]] and [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Emil]], followed by two guards. The guards notice the party on a wanted poster, and become hostile.

====== The Resistance ======


Emil and Delphine invite the party to follow them and escape the city by avoiding military buildings (the only targets of the air raid).

The resistance hideout is an unfinished hotel along the southern shore of Neverwinter, outside of the city walls. It's just columns and concrete floor, along with some concrete walls.

It is here that the party meets the "rest of" the resistance:

  * [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Stannis Ulam]]
  * [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Amy Sandbar]]

The conversation likely naturally makes a turn towards the weapon the party witnessed, and the Gerbaut scientist ([[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Eddard Teller]]) they encountered.

Stannis Ulam takes a keen interest in this, as, unknown to the party, he co-invented the device, but never saw it in effect. This prompts him to take the party to speak with [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Leosh Teller]], whom he merely calls "a talented artificer". Leosh has seismometers in several locations, and should be able to confirm the party's story.

===== Leo's Artificing =====

This artificer is inside the city walls, and the party is wanted, so they will need to disguise themselves. Stannis Ulam enters through a lightly guarded portcullis. The guard on this shift is under the effect of a **Geas** spell, so the entrance is uneventful.

Leo's Artificing is a quaint shop down a small cobbled alleyway. Numerous magical items are on sale, including what seem to be very powerful magical weapons. All of them are very good fakes, thanks to **Nystul's Magic Aura**. In reality this shop is a front for Resistance operations, and the entirety of the "income" this shop makes, comes in the form of stolen Gerbaut gold.

Leosh desires a conversation with Stannis in the back room, and if the party attempts to, they overhear a conversation about the weapon. Leosh recorded seismic readings alright, which means the weapon finally works.

===== Resistance Efforts =====

The current members have a game plan. Weaken the Gerbaut defenses from the inside, then report to the Oosah military that they can invade.

==== Advanced Weapon Shipment ====

Some advanced infantry weaponry is apparently being shipped into Neverwinter. These are [[wiki:orkridge:items#Experimental Repeating Rifle]] and [[wiki:orkridge:items# Experimental Revolver]] prototypes.

  * The weapons will enter the city by //steam powered jetski//.
  * Then will be transferred to a //horse powered quadcycle//.
  * And finally taken to the elite garrison in downtown Neverwinter.

Success means stealing or destroying the weapons, and escaping without leading the enemy to the hideout. Resistance members are willing to assist, though it is likely that they will need to focus on auxilliary functions such as making sure the gate is open when they make their getaway.

==== Electrical Prototypes ====

[[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals|Azusa Actor]] was coerced by the Gerbaut military to turn her research efforts to the Gerbaut military cause, under threat of redistributing ownership of the family industry to Gerbaut citizens. The laboratory where she is developing these weapons is on the 20th story of [[wiki:orkridge:Neverwinter#Actor Tower]].

This needs to happen during the Actor Tower ribbon cutting ceremony, in order to divert suspicion away from her, as she will be present at the ceremony.

Some weapons on the 20th floor are powered by the electricity developed by the steam engines in the basement.

  * **Mecha Chimera**: A regular **Chimera**, but instead of a breath weapon, each head can fire a taser once during the battle.
  * **Robo Golem**: **Flesh Golem**, but with Plate Armor.
  * **Electromagnetic Turret**, Fires a piercing sabot each round.
    * This is represented by a **Lightning Bolt** that does 6d6 **piercing damage** instead of 8d6 lightning damage.

Each prototype weapon is powered by an armored tether with AC 18, but an HP of 5. Severing this tether disables the weapon.

There are a number of non operational prototypes and other items here too, including...

  * A flywheel powered motorbike.
  * A magnetic grappling hook.
  * A [[wiki:orkridge:items#Book of the Boar]]


===== Compromised Position =====

A fixed plot point is that the party is somehow tracked by the Gerbaut, either through their own blundering, as the result of a chase, or thanks to the efforts of a particularly cunning Gerbaut officer.

They are fired upon at great distance by powerful ballistae, at which point [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Stannis Ulam]] immediately hides behind cover and announces that he needs 1 minute to cast **Teleportation Circle** to get everyone out.

Ideally this happens right after the characters get a short rest after destroying the electrical prototypes.

//Note: This encounter involves a fireball, and thus may involve one or more instagib. This is technically not an issue for a party of this level, but make sure they had the opportunity to be prepared with some sort of healing.//

NPC stat blocks for the following encounter come from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3piisb/homebrew_the_kings_army_complete_monster_pack/| The Kings Army]] homebrew monster pack by **AshenBolt**

  * Two pairs of **Archer**s set up with [[wiki:orkridge:items#Crucifix Ballistae]] 400 feet away on some rooftops.
    * Theses ballistae provide half cover for the one archer firing it.
    * Players roll perception checks against a flat DC subject to DM discretion to notice this happening. Those who fail are surprised in the first round of combat.

36 seconds (6 rounds) pass before the ground forces make their move. 90 feet separate the rest of the buildings and the resistance hideout.

  * one back line **Blue Elf**
  * Two **Sergeant**s
  * 8 **infantrymen**

===== Escape =====

Assuming the party has some degree of success defending their position, [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals|Stannis Ulam]] completes the **Teleportation Circle**, and the rest of the resistance begins to head through. Stannis and Leosh wait for the party to go through, but as the party reaches the circle, it shuts down.

The permanent circle was compromised, and the resistance was teleporting into a trap.
Stannis changes the runes to a different permanent circle, and tells the party to alert Oosah of the weapon and of the resistance's position. He and Leosh stay behind as the rear guard, then **Dimension Door** to narrowly escape and attempt to save their friends.
