====== Campaign Notes ======

During the night, **The Goose** wanted to go out to pee, but smelled beef jerky. He followed the scent to the nearest hospital, where he wreaked havoc, and got super high on **Dreamily jerky**.

Zanriel got some "services" from a mob water elemental.
===== Character Goals =====

==== Zanriel ====

=== Boromar Clan ===
Working with the Boromar Clan to build smuggling trade routes to New Elfington (since Thrane is setting up a quarantine.)

That being said, they're not happy with his performance at the United Kingdoms, so his room key at the luxury hotel is invalidated, with a note left for him. "Everybody gets one."

=== Hexblade ===

Hexblade asks Zanriel to steal the hot rock for him.

Hexblade is tired of Shadowfell, and it's not alone. It and his comrades want light.

After [[wiki:orkridge:Chapter 1#The Device | a random mountain]] teleports to Shadowfell, it realizes that whatever magic caused this could be used to teleport his entire city into the plane of light.

It is in the interest of this goal that it employs a number of Warlocks to collect items and information of relevance to this teleportation magic. When one of his warlocks is teleported during the events of [[wiki:orkridge:chapter_5| The Financial Crash]], it realizes that whatever material [[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh]] used could speed his efforts.

It needs the lichium used in Eberronian Sky Coaches. Once it collects enough, it creates the device, and teleports the entire cliff city of Edgeton to... Eberron, right at the end of the [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)]]. That's right, directing the device is //hard//.


==== Char Marks ====

Talking with [[wiki:notable_individuals#Magi Suko]] about getting medical supplies to New Elfington (potentially via a Boromar Smuggling route).

Also interested in getting more involved in science.

Also looking to build up an industry either here or in Faerun.

Travel to Aundair to further hash scientific details falls under the side/main quest [[wiki:orkridge:Lichium]]
==== P4-A1 ====

Looking to take down the orbital blockade net by finding members of the previous government.

The war has only just ended, and most effort has been on rebuilding, not getting back into space, but it is rumored that the control bunker is still dormant somewhere in [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#Metrol]].
==== Wedge ====

[[wiki:notable_individuals#Laurens ir'Tain]] mentions to Wedge when they're leaving.

"Oh. You there. I've been looking for an outsiders touch on something. Come by the ir'Tain manor if you're up for some well paying work."

He is hiring Wedge to resolve the [[wiki:orkridge:Altered Cats]]


=== Sledge ===

As a rookie sniper, Wedge and Sledge were paired up, doing security sweeps in the [[wiki:orkridge:the_lost_peaks|Northern Forest]]. Supposedly some Elves were giving the eggheads trouble. Unfortunately, partly because of the orders given to him, and partly through his own failures, the mercenary company is ambushed by the elves.

**Sledge**, Wedge's spotter, dies.

Eventually, the merc company pulls back, and the Gerbaut push the Elves out.

The **Necromancer** that will be in charge of **The Ghoulash** finds **Sledge** just as he dies.
//"Hexblade. I have another one for you."//

=== Undead Sledge ===

Wedge is assigned to guard **The Ghoulash**, where he recognizes his close friend in skeleton form. At some point they have an intimate conversation.

//"Wedge, my friend. What is left to believe in, when you are betrayed by your own? When all that you are, all that you have done, is buried beneath the lies and the deceit of corrupt men. I will die in this wretched place.//

//The Necromancer, Teller, Hexblade... All. Must. Die//

=== The Lost Peaks ===

//For three days, I have hunted The Necromancer. For three days, luck alone has saved his wretched life. Sniping your enemy is like hunting any other animal.//

Unfortunately, he is "killed" when he stays on the other side of the portal?

=== Eddard Teller ===

//This is the problem with justice, Wedge. You must take it into your own hands.//
==== Roveliss ====

Roveliss is aiming to create an underground zen network of bards. Unfortunately Eberron already has a network of bards, in the form of a corporate propaganda machine called **The Circle of Song**. Corrupted by the economic influence of the Dragonmarked houses, this organization primarily creates "sponsored content", and is always happy to have someone new to exploit.

Not everyone in this organization has given up though, and given some pushing, bards around Eberron might attempt to reclaim their artistic integrity.
===== Session 3 plans =====

It rains that night. When they wake up, they see a rainbow. For everyone except for Paul, this is the first time they've ever seen a rainbow, and it kinda hurts to look at. Paul realizes that he's never seen a rainbow on Faerun.

===== Session 6 Plans =====

  * If the party manages to kill the mimic from [[wiki:orkridge:Donald Quixote]]'s story, the town and media immediately start to converge around it.
  * It's the largest mimic in the world, and someone will almost certainly pay good money for it.
  * That being said, mimics are an endangered species here, so...

===== Session 7 Plans =====

  * Timothee Chalamet's parents are headed to **Passage** upon hearing that this mimic is on sale. His dad wants it donated to a museum.

===== Session 8 Plans =====

  * Fight the beholder.

    * Saying that his boss who he rarely talks to wants to talk to him specifically, and to meditate when he's done with the fight. Oh, see if Wedge wants to chat too.
    * Hexblades boss is [[wiki:notable_individuals#Danielle Droman]], who uses Hexblade to search out appropriate fighters to get into the real world in the future.

    * "For three days, I have hunted him. For three days, luck alone has saved his wretched life.
    * He gives Wedge his rifle, a VSS
      * loaded with subsonic force rounds. It does 1d6 force damage, but doesn't reveal your position if you miss.
    * He may need to search all of **Edgeton**, but finally runs into Hexblade's personal vehicle.
    * Hopefully they take it down.</del>

===== Session 12 Plans =====

  * There is one item that can heal Zanriel:
    * His space jam, which can only be accessed by someone who has done a lot of bludgeoning damage (ie: wedge)
  * The final leg of the race.
    * The magic school bus isn't actually in the race, so they don't need to fight the kids.
    * But a mysterious figure sends a Time-Stop cruise missile at them.
  * The masks and medical supplies aren't working very well. The effect seems to be purely psychological.
    * Things got especially bad when an aurora borealis appeared above for a short time, giving everyone migraines.
    * Magi Suko is arguing with Dron about the masks not being defective, but this being a different effect.
      * "I know this sounds strange, but we have a mind flayer on staff. Let them take a look.
      * This might happen as a magical video based conference call.
  * Also riots are starting to get out of hand, especially considering Char Actor basically endorsed Char Marks.
    * [[wiki:notable_individuals#Iyanna ir'Talan]] is pissed off at him for this too, since she's a cop and all.
  * Multiple people want the nuke
    * Hexblade needs it to get to the plane of light.
    * Breland and Aundair need it for nuke reasons, but also need to capture Char Marks.
    * Wedge needs it because he wants a nuke.

===== Session 13 Plans =====

  * We need to go back in time to when Zanriel defrauds the party.
    * He will need to get things past Char, Broham+Reda, and other unknown members.
  * [[wiki:notable_individuals#Iyanna ir'Talan]] comes at Char Actor for imitating the terrorist Char Marks, and for Char Marks being "one of theirs"
    * "I never wanted to be a terrorist. I just wanted to be able to pay rent."
    * "One mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter, fighting for the freedom to be able to pay rent. Look. I got these from the offices. Look how much they're paying this **Magi Suko** fellow. When was the last time you saw this person in the flesh?"
    * "..."
    * "Do you realize now? When things have deteriorated this far, revolution is needed to gain even the bare necessities.
  * Thin Anthony Hopkins tells the party bluntly:
    * They have a week in their time to handle their own business, but then those who are willing need to come with him to his world.
    * Shortly after, Danielle Droman says the same thing to Zanriel and Wedge.
  * The illness experienced by the residents of New Elfington are psychosomatic according to the mindflayer. They need to be brought to their home plane as soon as possible.
  * **Dwarren:** Orangutang that runs the library
