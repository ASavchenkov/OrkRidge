====== COLA ======

Grad students at the **Arcane Congress** in **Aundair: Arcanix**, want a **Cost Of Living Adjustment**. Negotiations have not been going in their favor so far, in fact, the Arcane Congress has rejected all offers to negotiate.

===== Introductions =====


[[wiki:notable_individuals#Leosh Teller]], in his travels, visits a bar in **Arcanix**, looking to get friendly with some researchers. He gets lucky and overhears some students talking about  **COLA** and joins their table.

//"Greetings fellow mages."//

//"Bit young to call yourself a mage are you?"//

//"Bit young to be in this bar too. Looks can be deceiving. I couldn't help but overhear your conersation."//

//"Aah, so the Pinkertons are sending child soldiers now?"//

//"To the contrary. I'm not from here"//

//"No shit"//

//"You've heard of New Elfington, yes? Here, let me throw a hypothetical at you."//

//"A man breaks into your home with a knife, and robs you blind. You've called the watch and they said it was all on the straight and narrow. He does this twice a month. One day, you get tired and buy a shotgun. When he breaks the door down you blast him dead, and somehow you're the bad guy?"//

//"What I'm saying is your public image is... misleading. Revolutionaries always have a reputation for being aggressors, when in fact they're just fighting in self defense. They're telling you it's just business. Well, let's do business with them. I think it's time you balance the books a bit.//

This argument works on the grad students. **Leosh's** idea is to steal the materials necessary to build another device.

//"Can't remember where I heard this. 'If you want justice, you'll have to claw it from them', do damage, be dangerous. Make them take you seriously. Give them no other choice."//

Leosh quotes **Quellcrist Falconer**, from **Altered Carbon**, but he's not sure where he's heard it before.
==== Make it Personal ====

A Pinkerton spy was watching the whole exchange, and follows the students and Leosh to one of their homes, where they continue discussions.

The Pinkerton manages to break in, but is caught by a **Snare**. Leosh brings the group to face this intruder, who even has weapons, the point being that the Pinkertons are already moving on them, and the only option is to strike quickly and decisively.

//Remember. You make it personal, otherwise the creatures of power slide from under the machinery of justice with a wink and a grin.//

and he casts **Feeblemind** on the Pinkerton. This shocks the students, as it's an incredibly high level spell, but also incredibly cruel. Leosh then lets the Pinkerton out onto the street, to be found by the authorities in the morning.
