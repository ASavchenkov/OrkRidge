====== Campaign Notes ======

During the night, **The Goose** wanted to go out to pee, but smelled beef jerky. He followed the scent to the nearest hospital, where he wreaked havoc, and got super high on **Dreamily jerky**.

Zanriel got some "services" from a mob water elemental.
===== Character Goals =====

==== Zanriel ====

Working with the Boromar Clan to build smuggling trade routes to New Elfington (since Thrane is setting up a quarantine.)

Hexblade asks Zanriel to steal the hot rock for him.

Hexblade is tired of Shadowfell, and it's not alone. It and his comrades want light.

After [[wiki:orkridge:Chapter 1#The Device | a random mountain]] teleports to Shadowfell, it realizes that whatever magic caused this could be used to teleport his entire city into the Feywild.

It is in the interest of this goal that it employs a number of Warlocks to collect items and information of relevance to this teleportation magic. When one of his warlocks is teleported during the events of [[wiki:orkridge:chapter_5| The Financial Crash]], it realizes that whatever material [[wiki:orkridge:Leosh]] used could speed his efforts.

It needs the lichium used in Eberronian Sky Coaches. Once it collects enough, it creates the device, and teleports the entire cliff city of Edgeton to... Eberron, right at the end of the [[wiki:orkridge:Eberron#The Race of Eight Winds (Baka R)]]. That's right, directing the device is //hard//.
==== Char Marks ====

Talking with [[wiki:orkridge:notable_individuals#Magi Suko]] about getting medical supplies to New Elfington (potentially via a Boromar Smuggling route).

Also interested in getting more involved in science.

Also looking to build up an industry either here or in Faerun.

==== P4-A1 ====

Looking to take down the orbital blockade net by finding members of the previous government.

==== Wedge ====

More more-phine?

===== Next Session Plans =====

It rains that night. When they wake up, they see a rainbow. For everyone except for Paul, this is the first time they've ever seen a rainbow, and it kinda hurts to look at. Paul realizes that he's never seen a rainbow on Faerun.
